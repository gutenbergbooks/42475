<p>Upon the completion of the Tyrian Æra of this
Work, I submitted the outline to an Illustrious Prince,
whose urbanity and amiability are not the least of his
high qualities claiming admiration; and in reference
to my desire of Dedication, replied: "* * * With
respect to the request preferred, His Royal Highness
thinks,&mdash;especially with reference to <em>the subject-matter</em>
of the present historic Work, that it would
be far better to select for the Dedication, <em>some
Theologian of high rank in the Sacred Profession,
and eminent for his Learning and Piety</em>, under whose
auspices would more appropriately be placed, than
under his own, the Original History of Ancient America.
* * *" The suggestion and description thus
expressed by His Royal Highness&mdash;and from one in
such an august station,&mdash;evidently contemplate The
Primate.</p>

<p>The answer of Your Grace to my letter upon the
subject,&mdash;my sense of obedience to the suggestion of
His Royal Highness (who has honoured me as his
visitor and guest)&mdash;and my own feelings of profound
veneration for Your Grace;&mdash;together with the importance
of historically establishing the fulfilment of
additional prophecies by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>,&mdash;the Introduction of
Christianity into the Western Hemisphere by one of
The Twelve Apostles&mdash;<em>in person</em>;&mdash;the Founding of
Ancient America more than three centuries previous
to that Sacred event,&mdash;with the Identity of the Aborigines,
and thus unfolding additional Truths of The
Bible,&mdash;being of that Character to call forth attention
from every part of the Globe, where Civilization is
known, or the Divine Blessings of Religion are received
and appreciated;&mdash;these considerations all assure me
that in Dedicating to Your Grace the Original History
of Ancient America, I but follow the dictates of
an imperative duty;&mdash;and shall cherish the hope that
my literary labours upon this novel subject, will receive
the fostering protection of one, whose Life, Learning,
and Piety, are alike conspicuous,&mdash;and who, by their
triple power,&mdash;has been enabled to dare fearless comparisons
with the past,&mdash;to continue blessings to the
present,&mdash;and to create examples of faith and charity,
that may be imitated, but cannot be excelled, by those
of a future age.</p>

<p>With the fervent prayer that The Almighty Father
may long preserve the life and faculties of Your Grace,
that they may continue to cast their benevolent and
protecting influence around the Divine Institution of
Christianity;&mdash;I thus express my devotional duty,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Your Majesty</span>,
</p>

<p>With feelings of enthusiasm, founded on the contemplation
of a peaceful and a patriotic King, do I
inscribe to Your Majesty, the first Volume of an effort
to delineate the History of Ancient America.</p>

<p>If, in the following pages, Your Majesty should recognise
Your own portraiture in that of Hiram the
Great, it is such as truth and history have designed
and coloured;&mdash;fawning flattery and false adulation
have not added even a thought to embellish, where
Patriotism has so nobly consolidated.</p>

<p>The Building of Solomon's Temple at Jerusalem,
by Hiram of Tyrus, was not more generous, and
liberal in Religious sentiments, than were your own,&mdash;as
Protestant King of Prussia,&mdash;in laying the corner-stone
of the Catholic Cathedral of Cologne,&mdash;the
fervent words at which ceremony, Time will hallow
within his Archives: nor was your own branch of
Christianity forgotten or neglected; for the Sacred
City of Jerusalem previously recorded your Majesty's
munificence in promulgating the Divine Faith of
Salvation!</p>

<p>For the peace of Europe, and for the prosperity of
Prussia,&mdash;for the advancement of Religious and Civil
Liberty,&mdash;Education, Literature, the Arts and Sciences,&mdash;may
the Disposer of Events prolong the life,
and intellectual vigour of Your Majesty, to the utmost
verge of venerable age; and when the monument shall
enclose Your earthly remains, may Your subjects feel,
that Your Royal Ancestor,&mdash;Frederick of Prussia,&mdash;was
not the only Monarch of their father-land deserving
the time-honoured, and historic surname of "The
Great." I am flattered in the occasion which permits
me to render this tributary offering,&mdash;</p>

THE<br />
ORIGINAL HISTORY<br />
OF<br />
<b>ANCIENT AMERICA</b>.<br />
</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>To the deep historic interest expressed by his Royal
Highness the Duke of Cambridge, concerning the Aborigines
of America, may be traced the production of
this Work:&mdash;it led the Author originally to write the
Israel-Indian Tragedy of "Tecumseh,"&mdash;illustrative of
the patriotic race of the North, and which composition
has received the honour of being dedicated to the Illustrious
Prince by Special permission. The publication
has been delayed only from the fact, that it would
anticipate this branch of the present Work, and might
consequently be injurious.</p>

<p>The investigations necessary for writing of North
America, called into action the study and observation
of years in relation to South America: and in contemplating
the newly-discovered Ruined Cities and
Temples upon that moiety of the Western Continent,
the very spirit of the Romance of Truth, seemed to
find a voice in every Sculptured altar, column, stone,
or pyramid: and when upon the enthusiastic pursuit of
hidden knowledge, the sudden discovery of early
Christianity and its Sacred Promulgator, were identified
with the Western Hemisphere,&mdash;sanctioned as is
the discovery by Holy-Writ,&mdash;History,&mdash;Tradition,&mdash;Customs,&mdash;and
the oracular Sculptures of antiquity,&mdash;Language
has no power to express the bounding feelings
of the heart, when that original vision of the mind,
became apparent, as the stern reality of historic truth.</p>

<p>Knowing from experience, that Works upon Antiquities,
described in language cold as the marbles they
illustrate, are not of deep interest to the general reader,
the Author has, therefore, avoided the usual frigid
style, and has consequently placed around them such
fervent, and glowing words, as their novel characters
have authorized and demanded. In delineating, also,
the History of Tyrus, the chief events only are given;
and being rendered, with the artistical pages,&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">con
amore</i>,&mdash;the Poetry of History,&mdash;and not its dry prosaic
qualities will be received by the reader. This will
be seen in the descriptions of the classic Remains,&mdash;Battles,&mdash;and
Voyages,&mdash;and especially for instance, in
resuscitating the Ruins of Rome, and in the celebrated
Tyrian Siege by Alexander of Macedon,&mdash;but in this
style of writing (it is submitted) the Author has not
lost sight of that high solemnity demanded by the Philosophy
of History; without which, memorials of past
ages, or of our Fathers, would be useless.</p>

<p>To give a list of works consulted during fifteen years
in America, and more immediately for the last two
years in England, while writing the Tyrian Æra,
would be pedantic: but no Author, sacred or profane,
from the first Lawgiver to the present time, having
even a remote reference to the Western Hemisphere,
has been knowingly omitted; yet being professedly an
Original Work, the volume of the brain has been more
largely extracted from, than any writer whose works
are already before that Public,&mdash;to whose final judgment
(upon its merits or demerits) the present Author
submits the first History of Ancient America with all
humility; but he will yield to none in the conscientious
belief in the truth of the startling propositions,
and the consequent historic conclusions: and
that the reader may not imagine that any undue motive
dictated to the writer the publication of this Work,
the following extract from the Messrs. Longman's letter
upon their own, and their Reader's investigation of this
Volume will justify him. "* * * We have fully
considered the publication of your Work on America.
It is undoubtedly a Work of great ingenuity and
originality; and should it be considered that your
conclusions are correct, it will be a work to confer on
its Author a high rank in Literature. * * * We
shall be happy to be your Publishers. * * * *"</p>

<p>The usual "Table of Contents" has been avoided,
in order to prevent anticipation of the subject-matter
and secrets of the History; but, at the same time, for
after-reference, a copious Index has been placed at the
end of the Volume.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Introduction from the Preface to the Author's Historical Work upon
the Life of <span class="smcap">Tecumseh</span>&mdash;Name to be used for South or Central
America&mdash;The Fundamental Error of the Historians of America&mdash;Essential
Opposites in Character&mdash;Rules of Argument for illustrating

by <span class="smcap">Columbus</span>&mdash;The Cause of his Error and its Effects.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the prefatory remarks to the forthcoming work
upon the chieftain, Tecumseh, the following language
is used; and we avail ourselves of the privilege of
extracting from our own storehouse, materials for the
commencement of this new historical campaign.</p>

<p>"The courteous reader in tracing the fate of Tecumseh,
as depicted in the pages of his life, will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
fail to observe the strong analogy between the religious
sentiments of the chief of the forest, and those
of the ancient Hebrews. The language as uttered
by Tecumseh is not written by the pen of fiction,
merely to uphold a theory of the brain, but gathered
from the archives of a people's history, to support a
theory of apparent truth. The present writer will
not yield to any man in the firm belief, that the Aborigines
of North America (<em>but North America only</em>),
and the ancient Israelites are identical, unless controverted
by the stern authority of superior historical
deductions. We, therefore, have formed an original
theory in reference to the natives of the North, and
those of South and Central America, together with the
newly-discovered ruined Cities in and around Guatamala;
and by that theory, have separated <em>into</em> <small>TWO</small> <em>distinct
races</em>, or people, the Aborigines of the Western
Hemisphere.</p>

<p>"The lately recovered Ruins, Cities, and Temples in
Central America, and of which no ancient record is to
be found, have shattered the chain of acknowledged
History to atoms; and until that chain is again united
by a firmly established theory,&mdash;Education herself
must pause, ere she can with the wand of truth,
point to her rising children the History of the World,
or its inhabitants.</p>

<p>"Suspicion has asserted that <em>all</em> the natives of the
continent of Columbus, might probably have been
originally of Hebrew extraction; the assertion has
been made in doubt and trembling; for writers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
been confounded by essential contrasts in the Religious
customs of North and South America; there were no
analogies between them; which circumstance should
have compelled Historians to pursue another path of
inquiry, and so attain a conclusive truth; but they
found a Gordian knot which they could not unravel,
and assuming the impatient weapon of Alexander, they
destroyed it. The Architecture, however, of the Ruins
of Copan, Palenque, Uxmal, and their time-honoured
associates, has furnished a 'rosetta-stone,' to aid the
new translation of the hieroglyphical history of (now)
<em>ancient</em> America; and if our theory is true, not only
have the Israelites walked the land where the Sun
bestows his last smile, but another nation (in which
was retained the primitive language of the Diluvian
world) previously trod that soil as Aborigines; and
beyond all this, if our thread of Ariadne lead us faithfully,
if not, the <span class="smcap">Almighty Father</span> who gave the
thought will pardon its application; yes, beyond all
the bounding feelings leaping at events, at once classic
and venerated, do we contemplate another branch of
our theory; for, if we do not write in error,&mdash;and our
perfect faith assures us that we do not,&mdash;then the
trembling hand which sought in doubt <span class="smcap">The Saviour's</span>
wounds, has been outstretched in sacred oratory even
in those southern wilds: the bold, yet conquered
voice, which uttered in hallowed and confirmed faith,
'<span class="smcap">My Lord and my God</span>!' has given forth its missioned
eloquence even in the Western Hemisphere, and there,
the sainted ashes of that Apostle may yet repose!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The preceding extract may be viewed as the exordium
of an original history to follow; wherein, "if
we fail," it will be "the boldness of the <em>attempt</em>, and
not the <em>deed</em> confounds us."</p>

<p>Taking as a basis for our illustration the rules of
argument, we will first identify one race, and then
prove that the existence of another is not only apparent,
but absolute. For the convenience of the
general reader, the word "Mexican," until the true
name is established, will be applied throughout the
following pages to all Central and South America;&mdash;for
the word "south" may be confounded with that
portion of the Republic of North America so denominated,
and especially with the American reader.
The fundamental error with all writers upon the
Aborigines of America is, that they have viewed
them <em>as one people</em>. Authors have, therefore, been
confounded by the different customs and ceremonies
of religion as practised in the two great divisions of
the continent; they have seen that the natives were,
to a certain extent, in one part of the vast domain, idolaters,
and not in the other; that the North was essentially
republican in every aspect of its political
existence, while that of Mexican America was as
essentially composed of kingdoms and empires, and
governed by despotic monarchs, and that republics
were interwoven with them; that each man in the
North was a warrior, and an equal, acknowledging no
superior but their leader in time of battle, and should
he fall in action, there was not a member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Tribe in which they politically lived, but could have
taken his place, and filled it with similar courage and
ability. In Mexican America they were not equal,
but from the emperor they descended by degrees to
the serf and slave; in that country, stone and stuccoed
Temples and Palaces were, and still continue to
be found, erected with costly magnificence, and in
which were jewelled idols, to which they bent the
knee; their rich dwellings were splendid mansions,
adorned with sculptured and beaten gold, and graced
with the works of art, and as a people, enjoying all
the refined elegancies of life;&mdash;but in the North
their Temple was the azure canopy of Jehovah,
adorned with its myriads of golden stars, and when
beneath that sublime dome, they bent the knee, it
was to the Almighty God alone! Their palaces were
the gorgeous vistas of the forest; the columns were
the gigantic trees, each year increasing in their stateliness;
their shadowy and painted roofs were the far-spreading
branches, and nature's tinted foliage; their
mansions were those of independent wanderers, even
the simple tents of Israel; and as for jewelled idols and
figures of beaten gold,&mdash;they presented the diamonds
of the human eye, radiant with intellectual beams,
and glancing from the living emblem of the first and
priceless image, placed in Eden's garden by the Architect
of the Universe!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these essential opposites in character
and policy, to which may be added that of
physiognomy, writers have glanced at them as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
race, sprung from the same branch of the human
family, and without defining which; and when they
could not reconcile such apparently unaccountable
distinctions and diversities, they have thrown upon the
shoulders of the Mexican, the mantle of manly virtue
belonging to the North; and upon this race they have
thrust the idolatrous vices and the festering robes of
luxury justly claimed by the former people; and by
this easy manner of disposing of a question, have
seemingly satisfied themselves that by blending the
crimes of both, to the exclusion of the virtues of
either, that they were all "<em>savages</em>," and no matter
from whence they came. Thus have they formed their
conclusions concerning fifty millions of human beings,
although directly in opposition to evidences of fact, to
deductions by relative reasoning, and to all Christian
feeling, which alone should have rejected so cruel a
decision, founded as it is, not only on slight, but careless
investigation.</p>

<p>A sufficient identity of the Northern native is now
required, in order to establish the national distinction
between the Aborigines of the two Americas.</p>

<p>In all civilized countries when the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex scripta</i> fails
to develope, or protect, the historical events and rights
of a nation or of an individual, then the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex</i> <small>NON</small> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scripta</i> is
not only not rejected, but it is actually brought forward
to establish, and support the customs and privileges of
a by-gone day. This traditionary evidence, handed
down from sire to son, is received in proof of "a foregone
conclusion:" it gives an insight into the times, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
which no written record is left for the investigation of
Argus-eyed posterity; it carries us back to customs, civil,
military, and religious, that otherwise might be lost to
the archives of history. Admitting, therefore, this
train of reasoning, we bring it to bear upon the present
important subject;&mdash;important in the highest
degree, for the time is now past when the Western
Hemisphere is to be dated from the <em>re-discovery</em> by
Columbus. His giant, but over-applauded name, like
the ruins of Palenque, is but the lettering of a volume
to indicate in the library of the universe that such a
work was written&mdash;the work itself (<em>i. e.</em> the great continent)
has yet to be read, and the historical authors
identified; nor will the well-grounded supposition that
the Welsh prince, Madoc, colonised in America two
centuries before the Genoese; or that the Norwegian
landed three centuries anterior to the Welsh, enable us
even to unclasp the volume;&mdash;to accomplish this, and
its translation, an historic &OElig;iliad must be cast over a
period of more than two thousand annual changes, of
nature's revolving but faithful time-glass! Granting
then, that when the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex scripta</i> will not cover a subject,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex</i> <small>NON</small> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scripta</i> must be investigated to establish
a position;&mdash;the first, then, will not apply to
the Aborigines of the <em>north</em>, for it does not exist; the
latter only, or the unwritten history of their race must
be had recourse to, to prove their originality and
identity; traceable back to time immemorial, from
their present customs and traditions.</p>

<p>We think that it will instantly be admitted, that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
religious ceremonies are the strongest proofs of the
characteristics of a people or race, of which no written
history exists; for there is something so indescribably
sacred in the conscientious actions of man with the
Supreme God, that none but the maniac-atheist could
doubt, that those actions should be received as the
living features of a nation, when seen to be recognised
and acknowledged, with as much certainty of
identity, as when a mother gazes upon her fondly-cherished
child!</p>

<p>The customs forming the analogy between the
Northern natives and the ancient Israelites, will now
be reviewed with as much brevity as the subject will
permit, in order to establish an essential point of the
present theory&mdash;viz., the <em>separation</em> of the Aborigines
into <em>two</em> distinct people. The reader, perhaps, will
meet us at the threshold of argument by the question,
"How can an <em>Indian</em> be of Israel?" We will answer
this, and refute the misnomer before the analogies
are investigated. The name <em>Indian</em>, as applied to the
original inhabitants of either, or both the Americas,
Canada, the islands in, or adjacent to, the Gulf of
Mexico, has no authority founded upon truth. The
name was given in error, and has been so continued
from the time of the Genoese to the present day.
Throughout this work no position will be advanced
that cannot be defended. The wrongful appellation
originated with Columbus; and for proof of the assertion
the following is presented.</p>

<p>The shadow of the Earth upon the Moon during an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
eclipse, plainly testified that the planet upon which we
live was round. The travels of Marco Paulo by land
to the East Indies (about 1269), related that those
lands stretched far towards the <em>east</em>. About two centuries
after this, it occurred to Columbus, upon
perusing those travels; but more especially from having
obtained intelligence from the final conquest of the
Canary islands in 1483; and information while resident
in England (which circumstances will be investigated
hereafter), that by a voyage towards the <em>west</em>&mdash;thus
travelling, as it were, around the globe&mdash;<em>he should
meet the extremities of those lands</em>; and as the discovery
of a sea-passage to the East Indies was the
great object of navigation in the fifteenth century,
Columbus made the bold attempt (founded upon previous
knowledge of migration), and discovered the
island of St. Salvador and those adjacent, and thinking
that he had reached the eastern extremity of the
Indies according to his theory, he then named those
isles the <em>West</em> Indies, because they were discovered
by <em>sailing</em> west. The discovery of the Continent followed
during his third voyage, and believing all the
land to be of the Indies, the inhabitants of the isles
and of the mainland were, as a natural consequence,
called by Columbus under one general appellation,
viz., <em>Indians</em>. Subsequent geographical discoveries
have proved the great error of the Genoese; but the
name of <em>Indian</em> was given at that time, and it has
been continued although at variance with the truth;
<em>and it has had a material effect in checking inquiry</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<em>concerning the Aborigines</em>, who having been called
Indians, the name seemed at once to specify their
origin: but, it would have been equally as just, if he
had determined to sail for Britain, and an unforeseen
gale having cast him upon the island of Sardinia, and
then from believing that he had reached the intended
object of his voyage, he should have called the latter
inhabitants <em>British</em>. We, therefore, discard the name
of <em>Indian</em> as applied to the natives of the Western continent
(it will be retained in the Tragedy of "Tecumseh"
for local purposes), and write of them as the <em>Aborigines</em>,
until, as we advance in this History, they can be
identified by a national name, founded upon facts and
conclusions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Hebrew Analogies with the Tribes of the North&mdash;Contrasted with
the Natives of Mexican America&mdash;Circumcision&mdash;Scalping&mdash;Its
great Antiquity&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Crucifixion</span> not known to the Natives of
the North&mdash;Their Traditional Knowledge of the Deluge&mdash;Their
Practice of the Laws of <span class="smcap">Moses</span>&mdash;The conclusive Proofs of the <em>two</em>
Races&mdash;The Formation of a new Epochian Table for the History
of Ancient America&mdash;The announcement of the Historical
Theory, and the First Epoch.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Hebrew analogies now claim investigation; and
as Woman is first in the affections and in memory, she
claims by right upon this, as upon all occasions, the
natural precedence.</p>

<p>The Northern mother, after childbirth, is secluded
for a given number of days, <em>varying according to the
sex of the new-born infant</em>. By the law of <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, the
mother's purification was to last 40 days for a male,
and 80 days for a female child. <em>All other seclusions</em>
are as strict as when the wife becomes a mother.
When a wife becomes a widow, and is childless, <em>her
husband's brother marries her</em>,&mdash;these were essential
laws of the Hebrew, and especially the latter,&mdash;that
a name should not be lost in Israel.</p>

<p>As a mother she considers it a religious duty, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the child should receive its nourishment from the
breast that gave it life: and such is the feeling in the
performance of this maternal duty, that she often
nurses her offspring until it attains three or four years
of age. From this fact an important problem is solved,
viz., the apparent tardiness in the ratio increase of the
Aborigines of the North:&mdash;for it is the rule in Nature's
female code (and should there be an exception, it
only proves the rule), that while that affection continues
from the fond practice of the mother, no other
shall arise to destroy that which already exists: but,
as that ceases and the first-born is put away, Nature
jealous of her supremacy, again bestows upon the mother
a second joy, and so continues in her undeviating
course. There is, also, a direct physical analogy between
the Northern mothers and those of ancient
Israel; if there were not, the negative might be brought
against this theory: we therefore take advantage of
the affirmative. The only cause of Pharaoh's <em>political</em>
action against the Hebrews was, that from the rapid
ratio in which they multiplied, they would eventually
rebel, and with, or without the assistance of any other
nation entirely subdue Egypt. The ease of childbirth
by the Hebrew mother is distinctly stated in
Holy-Writ, in contrast to the dangerous sufferings
of the Egyptian parent; from which fact may be
gathered the cause of the gradual, but certain increase
of the Israelites over the Egyptian population.
The same peculiar facility of childbirth is one of the
chief characteristics of the Northern female, for in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Rocky Mountains, while journeying in cavalcade, and
being taken in travail, the mother will leave her companions
alone, and within an hour, will remount her
horse, and overtake her associates, with the new-born
infant in her arms! The cause why the population of
the Aborigines of the North is not in ratio with the
ancient Hebrews, has already been alluded to, in reference
to the mother's belief and practice of extended
maternal duty and fondness.</p>

<p>If, as we believe, the great ancestresses of these
Northern women were <em>Leah</em> and <em>Rachel</em>&mdash;the "tender-eyed,"
the "beautiful and well-favoured,"&mdash;then have
their daughters on the Western continent lost no
features of the mothers of Israel;&mdash;for they might hang
<em>their</em> harps upon the willows of their fate, as emblems
of Jerusalem's children in captivity, and feel no shame
in comparison of sorrow, grace, or beauty!</p>

<p>The Northern Aborigines have a traditional knowledge
of the Deluge and the Dove of peace, which to
them under the name of the "medicine," or "<em>mystery</em>
bird," is sacred from the arrow of the hunter. They
have their <em>Ark of Covenant</em>, in which is deposited some
mystery, <em>seen only by the priests</em> of the Tribe,&mdash;it is said
to be a shell, and supposed to give out oracular sounds:
this is in analogy to the Book of the Laws placed in
the Ark of Covenant by <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, preceding his death
on Mount Nebo,&mdash;the oracular wisdom of which has
guided civilization to this day. The ark is <em>never suffered
to touch the earth</em>, but is always raised on a
stand of wood or stone; it is invariably carried by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Tribe when they march to battle,&mdash;a similitude is here
to <span class="smcap">Joshua</span> at the siege of Jericho. When it is in their
peaceful encampment, it is surrounded by <em>twelve stones</em>,
indicative of the original number of the Tribes of their
ancestors;&mdash;this is strictly in analogy with the twelve
statues (probably rude blocks of stone) erected by
<span class="smcap">Moses</span> around the Altar of the Covenant to personify
the twelve tribes of Israel. <span class="smcap">Joshua</span>, also, after the passage
of the Jordan, erected <em>twelve stones</em> in his encampment
at Gilgal, and the same number in the river at
the place of the passage. They select their "medicine
men" (<em>i. e.</em> priests or prophets) from among a portion
of the tribe <em>not warriors</em>; here is the custom of the Levites,
or descendants of <span class="smcap">Aaron</span> being in the sacred office
of priesthood, for with the Israelites they were not to be
taken from the ranks of the soldiery. These Aborigines
"dwell in booths," as when "brought out of the land
of Egypt," for they are still wanderers. [Lev. xxiii.]
They offer a flesh, or burnt-offering from the chase,
which is first cast into the flames, before even a
starving family may eat. They have their corn and
harvest feasts; also, one in observance of every new
moon,&mdash;another in festivity of the first-fruits,&mdash;<em>and
the great feast in direct analogy with the Hebrew
Passover</em>, even to the blood being stained upon the
posts and lintels, and the mingling of the most bitter
herbs! Then their fastings and purifications are practised
with the greatest severity. The breastplate, or
ornament worn by their religious prophets, containing
<em>twelve shells</em>, or stones of value, is in direct imitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the ancient Pectoral worn by the Hebrew high-priest,
and which contained <em>twelve precious stones</em>, inscribed
with the names of all the twelve original tribes
of Israel. They have their <em>cities of refuge</em>, or huts of
safety, where the most deadly foe dare not enter for
his victim. They never violate a female captive, and
upon the Hebrew principle, that their blood shall not
be contaminated by interunion;&mdash;this has been strictly
followed in all their wars with the Europeans. They
also reject the savage practice <em>of civilization</em> upon the
lofty principle of manly virtue!</p>

<p>The "medicine-bag" or pouch is carried by every
member of the Tribe;&mdash;it is suspended to a bead-belt,
which crosses the breast by passing over the left
shoulder, and hangs on the right side; it contains, as
they say and believe, <em>preservatives</em> to keep them from
sickness or defeat. These are essentially the <em>phylacteries</em>
referred to by <small>THE</small> <span class="antiqua">SAVIOUR</span>, and previously
condemned by <span class="smcap">Moses</span>; for the word <em>phylactery</em> is derived
from the Greek tongue, and denotes a <em>preservative</em>;
and in the time of <span class="smcap">Moses</span> they were worn
by his people in great excess; and so by the Northern
native. <span class="smcap">Moses</span> checked the excessive use of the "preservatives"
and changed the custom; for by his command
the priesthood alone wore the phylactery, which
was at last a frontlet of parchment for the forehead,
upon which was written an extract from the laws, that
"those that run might read."</p>

<p>Then the absence of all idols or symbolical devices,
and the worship of <em>the One God</em> (<em>i. e.</em> Great Spirit);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
their never pronouncing <em>the name</em>, <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>, but in
syllables, and those separated by long ceremonies,
thus truly fulfilling the Hebrew law, "Thou shalt not
take the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord Thy God</span> in vain." The
name with them sounds as if written, <em>Ye-hoh-vah</em>, and
is only pronounced by the Aaron of the tribe. In
their hymns of rejoicing, the word <em>Hal-le-lu-yah</em> is
distinctly uttered. To the foregone analogies is to be
added the general and firm belief in <em>the Immortality
of the soul!</em> But beyond all this as proof of their
origin, is the practice of the great covenant between
the <span class="smcap">Almighty Father</span> and the Patriarch Abraham&mdash;viz.,
<em>Circumcision!</em> And it does not exist, as in parts
of Egypt and the Asiatic nations, for the purpose of
supposed health, (in which belief it was practised in
ancient Egypt by <em>both</em> sexes,) but as a <em>religious</em>
custom, handed down from time immemorial! The
custom now is not general, but it does exist; and we
must be understood as referring back at least two
hundred years in our review, to the period of the
Pilgrim Fathers, when the Northern Aborigines numbered
<em>fifteen millions</em>,&mdash;now they scarcely number two
and a half! All the customs, however, noticed, are
practised at the present period by the uncontrolled
Aboriginal. If all other evidences were not received,
that of Circumcision, as a <em>religious</em> ceremony, must be
viewed by the most sceptical, as direct proof of identity
between the Northern Aborigines and the ancient
Hebrews. The custom we have written is not general,
it is only found in the more <em>settled</em> tribes; this even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
supports our belief, for in this very fact is traced again
the precedent ordained by <span class="smcap">Moses</span>; for circumcision was
<em>discontinued</em> by the great Lawgiver for forty years,
during his journeying with his followers through the
wilderness; the custom was re-established by <span class="smcap">Joshua</span>.
May not this innovation by <span class="smcap">Moses</span> in the covenanted
custom be imitated by these descendants? Are they
not still wanderers in the wilderness in the western, as
their ancestors were in the eastern hemisphere? The
affirmative has existed for ages, and it even now continues.
They have not yet returned to Jerusalem!</p>

<p>One fact is of great importance in proof of their
great antiquity&mdash;viz., they have no knowledge or tradition
in the North of the Life or Crucifixion of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
yet they have a knowledge of the Deluge, and actually
practise the laws of Moses. Again we must repeat,
that we are writing of these Aborigines as they were at
the time of European colonization.</p>

<p>The above singular fact enables us at once to place
them in a chronological position. It must be <em>after</em>
Moses but <em>before</em> <span class="smcap">The Savior</span>; but another fact
brings their circle of time still narrower&mdash;viz., they
have no tradition of the destruction of the first Temple
of Jerusalem. This event occurred 588 years before
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, it must, therefore, be <em>anterior</em> to that national
calamity, that they trace their origin. Of this, hereafter,
when in the next volume the history of the
Israelites will be given; but, even now, justice to this
race compels us to offer a few words in their defence
as a people, for being already sufficiently shewn that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
they are of the great Hebrew family, they may fall in
the estimation of some readers upon religious principles.
It has been shewn that they have no tradition
of the Crucifixion, or of the desolation of the Temple.
Is there no sentiment in the mind of the Christian
reader as the first fact is unfolded, other than that of
historical data? Upon a moment's thought it must be
apparent that, <em>the blood of</em> <span class="smcap">Christ</span> <em>cannot be upon
them or their children</em>! Their ancestors never shouted
in the streets of Jerusalem, "Crucify him! crucify
him!" The Aborigines of the North are <em>Israelites</em>, and
of the house of Jeroboam, <em>not Jews</em>, <em>i. e.</em>, of the House
of Judah; a distinction of all importance, as the pages
of the subsequent volume will prove.</p>

<p>The custom of Scalping cannot be said with truth
to be original with the Northern native: it has, however,
been so asserted, as proof that they are more
modern as a people than this theory would establish;
but the declaration "melts into air, into thin air,"
from the fact, that both Herodotus and Polybius mention
scalping as being practised among the most ancient
nations of the world. The assertion, therefore, has only
brought forward its refutation. Scalping was introduced
originally by the ancients for the express purpose of
counting and recording the number of the foe slain
in battle: and especially was this custom practised by
the Scythians: this is established upon the authority of
the accurate Herodotus. For the same reason is the
custom followed by the Aborigines of the North&mdash;viz.,
to number the slain of the enemy. Again, Scythia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was the ancient name of the country now known by
the modern name of Tartary. This is important, as
will be shewn in the next volume, in tracing the encampments
of the <em>Israelites</em> after their escape from
captivity; for in the Scythian Tartary they will be
found: and consequently the custom may have been
derived from their own remote ancestors, who obtained
it from the Scythians. The custom with both was
(and in the North still <em>is</em>), only for a trophy of the
<em>dead</em>, and, therefore the scalp is never taken from a
<em>living</em> enemy. Polybius, however, has a Draconian
record&mdash;viz., that upon the occasion of <em>Gisco</em> the Carthaginian
being made prisoner, together with 700 of
his soldiers, they were all scalped <em>alive</em> by the rebel
mercenaries under Spondius. The ancients, also, wore
the long scalp-locks as the flowing hair to their rude
helmets and weapons: the natives of the North do the
same as records of their personal victories. This
subject has been dwelt upon, in order to prove its
great antiquity.</p>

<p>We may here remark that the mutilation of the
dead for the purpose of numbering, was nearly a
general practice among all the ancients. The Scythian,
it has been shewn, took the scalp and the hair-lock;
but the Assyrian and the Egyptian had another method&mdash;viz.,
by the number of <em>ears</em> sent to the king or
general. This is glanced at in Ezekiel xxiii. 25; but
when imposition was practised by the soldiers of the
latter nation (after a general rapine and massacre), by
sending home the <em>ears</em> of their female victims in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to increase their reward upon the supposition that
they had been taken from men,&mdash;an original custom
of recording the slain warriors, was then introduced
(to check the imposition) for proving the <em>sex</em> of the
fallen. The latter proof of victory was a condition
from David to Saul, for obtaining the daughter of the
latter in marriage. [1 Samuel xviii. 25-27.] The
Hebrew, therefore, followed the custom from the
Egyptian, who practised it previous to David's victory
over the Philistines, which was in the year of his marriage,
1063, <small>B. C.</small>; it is, therefore, probable that a
knowledge of this Egyptian custom may have been obtained
by the Hebrews during their bondage in that
country&mdash;the Exodus took place 1491, <small>B. C.</small> The remote
antiquity of these repulsive customs are, therefore,
firmly established. Scalping is one of them, and
is, and ever has been, practised in Northern America.
While upon the subject of War, and its worst horror&mdash;viz.,
Rapine&mdash;it may be here mentioned again, and to
the eternal honour of the Northern Aborigines, and
as a stern reproof to the wars of civilization (?) that
they have never been known to violate a female captive
among their own race, upon the principle that it
placed shame upon the warrior's glory. This noble
manhood has also extended the same mercy to the
<em>white</em> female prisoner, as to those of their own colour.
Is there not the ancient Hebrew even in this? And
is not their national abhorrence of interunion with any
people but their own traceable in this custom? They,
also, upon the same principle, will not marry or cohabit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with the pale-face race, or with any not of their
own blood. We write of the Aborigines as they were,
and of the mass. There may be on the frontiers some
solitary exceptions after their acquaintance with the
Anglo-Saxon race; but oftener among the women
than the men. This arises not from less virtue than
in the opposite sex; but, and with shame be it written,
from the seduction, treachery, and desertion by the
European. Most truly might a chieftain reply to a
missionary who endeavoured to convert a tribe.
"Teach <em>us</em>? What? My son has been murdered&mdash;my
daughter ravished by the white-man! Learn first
yourselves to obey the mandates of humanity, and
prove that we do not practise them; then come
among us to preach, or teach, and we will receive
you with open arms! When shall we meet
again upon this condition? On Earth, white man,
never!"</p>

<p>The marriage of the Virginian Aboriginal, Pochahontas,
was, <em>after</em> her baptism in the Christian faith,
and consequently cannot be brought to bear against
the preceding remarks. Many other religious customs
and ceremonies exist of a minor character, yet strictly
in analogy with the race of Abraham; but enough
has been brought forward in this volume to propose
these (as we believe) unanswerable questions: "If they
are not of the Lost Tribes of Israel, who are they?"
"What nation of ancient history can claim and identify
those customs and observances as their own, if not
the Hebrew?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Then in regard to the <em>physique</em> of the race, they
possess the essential characteristics of the ancient Hebrew
in regard to physiognomy&mdash;viz., the broad and
elevated forehead, the acquiline nose, the high cheekbone,
brilliant red countenance, and teeth pure as
ivory; black hair, the dark and heavy eyebrow, the
sunken but brilliant eye, like a diamond within a ring
of pearl, and both deep-set beneath a brow of ebony.
Their figures in youth (from their mother's care), are
models for the Apollo; and should the Statue be lost
(and with it all casts and engravings), it could be restored
from a living archer; for the attitude of the
Sun-God is daily assumed by them from the impulse
of Nature, when they wing their arrows at the Pythons
of the chase!</p>

<p>The reader must not imagine that our enthusiasm
upon the subject has betrayed us into the language of
poetic rhapsody; for we have the authority (apart
from our own experience) of Benjamin West, who,
when he first arrived at Rome to commence his studies,
was regarded as "a Savage from the New World." In
order to surprise him, the statue of Apollo was shewn
to him with great ceremony by the <em>Savans</em>, who expected
that he would be overwhelmed with wonder.
His simple remark was, "<em>Why, it is a model from a
young North American Indian</em>!" It was the highest
compliment that could have been given to the grace
and dignity of the statue.</p>

<p>The <em>colour</em> of the ancient Israelite must not be
judged by that of the modern Jew&mdash;for various climates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
local circumstances, and confined habitations, have
given the latter a dark, heavy, swarthy countenance,
and even in middle age they are bent in figure; but
the ancient light-red tint may be but the original of
the sunburnt features of the Aborigines, and they,
from their forest life, reach at least three score years
before old age compels them to see their shadows as
they walk!</p>

<p>The words of "the good friend" William Penn, may
be given as a peculiar and powerful authority. After
his first and celebrated interview with the Northern
natives, he wrote to England the following sentences
in reference to them: "<em>I found them with like countenances
to the Hebrew race, and their children of so
lively a resemblance to them</em>," &amp;c. At this, and no other
time did the thought of their being of the Lost Tribes of
Israel enter his imagination. The sentences, therefore,
are of great importance, from the fact that they were
not originally written by him to support any theory in
reference to the Aborigines; but merely asserted in his
letter from a strong impression of apparent truth, and
which fact, to the Founder of Pennsylvania, was a subject
of astonishment, and there it rested; for to him,
were they Hebrew or Gentile, his kind and philanthropic
heart, taught him to view them as a branch of
the human family, and that to him was sufficient for
forming a bond of amity! His memory is cherished
by the Aborigines to this day&mdash;as "the good friend."
The reader may remember the historical painting by
West, of this celebrated interview, it is worthy of the
subject represented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The bold style and metaphorical character of their
Oratory, is essentially Hebrew,&mdash;an attempt to illustrate
their eloquence will be found in the historical
tragedy of "Tecumseh."</p>

<p>Their undaunted and chivalric personal courage, is
the very counterpart of that evinced upon the plains
of Jericho, or in aftertimes before the walls of Jerusalem.
Then their god-like love of perfect freedom,&mdash;the
spirit of Jeroboam, did not die in the first rebellion
and victory against tyranny,&mdash;it lives in his nation's
descendants in the North; at invasions or encroachment,
they rise as one man, to crush their
oppressor, and which fact, every record from the Pilgrim
Fathers to the present day, will testify. In all
their battles (and their name is legion) they have disputed
the ground, inch by inch, and even their women
have fought and fallen in their ranks. Every chief
was a Judas Maccabæus, or an Eleazer Savaran!</p>

<p>Now in every physical characteristic of the Northern,
did the Mexican differ; they bore no analogy as
being of the same race, either in feature, courage, endurance,
or general religion. In Mexican America,
Cortez, with only 500 Spanish soldiers, and those
worn and dispirited, drove 50,000 Mexicans from the
field of Otumba,&mdash;they fled like snow-flakes before the
wind, when their standard was seized by a Spaniard;
but, in the North, the fight was man to man, and no
retreat&mdash;death or victory&mdash;Jerusalem or the grave!
Every chieftain of the North, even upon a supposition
of flight from a superior foe (either in number or
prowess), may be imagined to have uttered the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
words of Judas Maccabæus, when in his final battle he
was opposed by twenty times his own force: "God
forbid that I should do this thing, and flee from them;
if our time be come, let us die manfully for our
brethren, and not stain our honour!"</p>

<p>Some of the Mexican nations worshipped idols, and
knew not God!&mdash;for they sacrificed human beings to
propitiate their savage Deities; not so the noble
Northerns, they worship <span class="smcap">The One God</span>, who declared
to the first Lawgiver, "Thou shalt have no other
Gods before me," and their only human sacrifice is the
invader of their lands and birthright.</p>

<p>The only two analogies that existed between the
North and Mexican America, and which might apparently
destroy or prevent the proof of this theory, are,
first, Circumcision; and second, the similitude of Language.
In the North, circumcision, as we have shewn,
is a religious custom only; in the Mexican territories,
it was both <em>optional</em> and religious. This strange and
apparent stumbling-block in the way of proving that
they are of a different race, will be removed as we proceed;
for so far from injuring the proofs of the theory,
it absolutely supports them, as does also the analogy
in language. These important points&mdash;viz., Circumcision
and Language, will be met in their respective
places, and in an original manner of application; for
they form two of the most substantial evidences, and
were the primitive causes for our belief in the subject
contemplated by this work, and especially in reference
to that portion having Christianity for its basis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>As an essential contrast between the Aborigines, is
the fact that in the North they have (as already
stated) no tradition of the Crucifixion, while in the
other portion of the Continent (and for centuries
before the rediscovery by Columbus) they had a perfect
knowledge of every particular of the Life and
Death of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. Again;&mdash;in this part of the Continent
there are Stone architectural Ruins:&mdash;in the
North there are none; they possess there but embankments,
Marathonian mounds or tumuli. These
undeniable and characteristic opposites in Northern
and Mexican America, increased by the late
discovery of the Ruined Cities in Guatamala and
the adjacent provinces, together with fifteen years
of personal observation in America; to which may
be added a practical knowledge of the Fine Arts,
enthusiasm in research, and mature reflection upon the
entire subject, have authorized the formation of (as
we believe) an Original Theory, concerning the History
of the Aborigines of the two great divisions of
the Western Hemisphere; and for the unfolding of the
present volume, we state,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. <em>That they consist</em> of <small>TWO</small> <em>distinct races, or people</em>.
This will be, without doubt, admitted, from the facts
in the previous pages.</p>

<p>2. <em>That South America</em> (nationally speaking) <em>included
what is at present called Central America; and,
as a consequence, the Ancient Cities, now in Ruins,
belonged to the same general Empire</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <em>That South</em>, or (as we have termed it in the preceding
pages) <em>Mexican America, was inhabited</em> <small>ANTERIOR</small>
<em>to that of the North</em>.</p>

<p>4. <em>That the Aborigines of Mexican America, and
the West India Islands, were the ancient</em> <span class="smcap">Tyrians</span> <em>of
Ph&oelig;nicia</em>, and that they landed <em>on the Western Continent,
from their native country, more than two thousand
years ago</em>! <em>This is confirmed by Tradition,
Analogies, History, and Prophecy!</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Reasoning upon the causes that have led to the
new Historical Theory, and the conclusions arising
therefrom, a new Chronological or Epochian Table, as
a necessity, is required for the History of the Western
Hemisphere and its Inhabitants, at least to the time of
Columbus. Not desiring, however, to anticipate any
interest derivable from the investigation of this work,
the progressive Epochs will be given in the volumes
devoted to their illustration. The present volume
contemplates the first Epoch only, and is announced
in the following page, and the reader will do <em>himself</em>
but justice (apart from the author) by not rejecting
the startling Theory until (at least) the proofs and arguments
have been received and analyzed. Upon
which investigation the writer will submit with all
humility to the decision of the public, and of their
all-powerful champion&mdash;the Press.</p>

<em>Arrangement of Facts and Arguments</em><br />
FOR THE PRESENT VOLUME.
</p>


<p>In the endeavour to establish this important Epoch
recourse must be had to the same train of argument as
that used in the preceding pages&mdash;viz., that where the
<em>written</em> law does not exist, that which is <em>unwritten</em>
must be brought forward as evidence to support and
sustain conclusions, and to this must be added the
powerful witness of strong and perfect analogy, for the
essential purposes of identity. Believing that the
reader is convinced that the natives of North America
are of a distinct race to those inhabiting the
other portion of the Continent, as already illustrated
by the contrasts in their Religious and Political policies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and even by their physical analogies, the necessity now
arises of completely identifying those of Mexican
America, as we have slightly those of the North,&mdash;sufficient
however for the division of the races. In the
preceding title of the First Epoch of this History, is
not only stated the Nation from whence they came, but
even the Year in which they landed! To support
these startling assertions, to make their truth apparent
to the reader,&mdash;to convince his understanding and
crush all doubts,&mdash;that even History may place the
Volume within her archives, requires a basis of argument
which shall be rock-built, that the superstructure
about to be raised, while it invites, may yet resist (not
defy) the storms and shafts of criticism; but, as a
strong cemented edifice requires the warm influence of
the Sun to secure the component parts,&mdash;so do we
look for the sun-smile from the just and mild eye of
the true critic, which will not glance upon only one
part of the composition, but view each as required to
form the consistency of the entire building; and when
the edifice is finished, whether the entablature will remain
blank, or bear our humble name, is not for us to
determine or command; yet in reference to the latter
and natural hope, the sentiment of the Senator of
Utica will direct us,&mdash;that if we cannot "command
success," at least we will endeavour to "<em>deserve</em> it."</p>

<p>The following investigation and arrangements of argument
are required for the elucidation of this Epoch,
and then from the <em>summary</em> of evidence <em>and from that
only</em>, the reader, as a jury, will form his verdict: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Are the Fine Arts of sufficient authority to be
received as evidence for establishing historical records
or events?</p>

<p>2. The fact of the Discovery of the Ruined Cities
in Mexican America&mdash;their description, locality, and
character, established.</p>

<p>3. The Religious and National Analogies and Traditions,
between the ancient Tyrians and the Mexican
Aborigines will be investigated, and their Identity
established.</p>

<p>4. The Mexican innovations upon the customs of
the Tyrians will be explained.</p>

<p>5. The general History of Ph&oelig;nicia, but especially
the political and commercial History of the Kingdom
of Tyrus:&mdash;its Rise and Fall analyzed.</p>

<p>6. The <em>cause</em> of the Tyrian migration to the
Western Hemisphere&mdash;the means whereby, and the
date wherein it was accomplished,&mdash;the means of concealing
the secret of their Discovery of the Western
Continent from the Asiatics and Europeans.</p>

<p>7. The building of their first Altars, Temples,
Pyramids, and Palaces, and which have remained as
unknown in the History of the World, for full two
thousand one hundred and fifty years!</p>

<p>8. The new Discovery of the Fulfilment of <em>five
additional Prophecies, by</em> <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, identified and established
by the proofs of the Tyrian Epoch of this
History of Ancient America.</p>

<p>9. A Recapitulation of the entire subject, and
summary of the various evidences of the truth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Tyrian Theory, founded upon Analogies, Traditions,
History, and Prophecy!</p>

<p>And <small>LASTLY</small>. The fulfilment of the Tyrian Prophecies
of <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> in the Western Hemisphere, also establishes
(with the division of the Aborigines into two
races, Tyrian and Israelitish, and their conquerors) the
actual accomplishment of Noah's Malediction, and his
Prophecy of the Human Family! These astounding
and new-discovered facts will form a concluding chapter
for the complete annihilation of atheistical denial
of Prophetic truths. These prophetic facts are not
essential to the support of this History,&mdash;they are but
the seals to the document.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center">THE FINE ARTS, AS AUTHORITIES FOR HISTORICAL RECORDS,
INVESTIGATED AND ESTABLISHED.</p>


<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<h4>ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE.</h4>

<p>If it were possible to place within an Ephesian
Temple, every historic book, manuscript, and engraving
in the world, and then the sacrilegious torch of a
modern Erostratus should entirely consume them,
whereby the only apparent knowledge to be obtained
would be from tradition,&mdash;yet the marble and stone
quarries of the earth have issued those volumes composed
and fashioned by the hands of man, that would
restore the progressive history of the arts and civilization.</p>

<p>Architecture has erected his lofty temples, palaces,
and mansions; and Sculpture has, with her magic wand,
charmed and adorned them with historic facts, legends,
and romance: the former planned the porticoes, columns,
and proportions; but the latter was the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
whereby they were fashioned and embellished. Architecture
by his peculiar characteristic gives intelligence
as we wander amid his works, that we are on the land
of Egypt, or the plains of Pæstum: on the Acropolis
of Athens, or the land of Romulus and the Coliseum:
and whether we gaze upon the sky-pointing Pyramid,
the stern or the graceful Doric, the Ionic of the Ilissus,
or the acanthus-crowned Corinthian,&mdash;they one and
all have voices of oracular power, proclaiming to the
classic scholar the Nation from whence they arose to life
and beauty.</p>

<p>Even the horizontal and curved lines of Architecture
have their especial records; for they state the
time in the history of the Arts, when they were
erected, even without a sculptured cipher;&mdash;for the
level lines of the Cyclopean and Egyptian walls, with
their attendant apertures, give certain knowledge that
they were erected <em>before</em> the principle of the Grecian
<em>arch</em> was known or practised.</p>

<p>Sculpture has a more harmonious voice than that
of her stern consort;&mdash;the graceful bride, whose rock-ribbed
cradle amid the Parian hills&mdash;whose virgin
youth reposed upon the halcyon marble of Pentelicus,
has a voice of warm, yet chaste simplicity,&mdash;her tones
are as sweet, as from lips first nourished on Hymettus'
Hill; yet at times they speak with all the solemnity of
her consort, around whom she fondly clings, as the
ivy around the oak; and like that plant and tree, the
sculpture-vine preserves for ages the character of the
marble monarch of the Arts, even after his broad-spreading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
authority has been broken and humbled to
the earth by Time and Desolation; or these two destroying
powers may be viewed as the Regan and the
Goneril, while Architecture is the Lear, and Sculpture
the Cordelia of the Arts!</p>

<p>Even as a note of music struck from a chord of
Nature vibrates to the heart, in like manner does the
voice of Sculpture reach and echo around the walls of
Life: it is Poetry's diapason&mdash;it speaks of God and
His works&mdash;of Man in his intellect and glory&mdash;of
Woman in her charity and beauty: it speaks a language
which the unlettered may translate, while to
her more subdued or secret tones, the disciples of her
heavenly power have but to listen, or behold <em>her
action of utterance</em>, as developed in her free or drapered
limbs, to give the history of her thoughts; nor
have those thoughts or attitudes, chaste as the marble
they inhabit, ever been conquered by lust or luxury,&mdash;that
unworthy conquest was reserved for the false
disciples of her faith, yet not over herself, but her fair
handmaid&mdash;Painting. But Architecture and Sculpture
have lived on&mdash;severe and chaste, stern and graceful,
majestic and beautiful&mdash;as when they were first
created from the Eden of the mind! No sword of
wrath has driven them forth to wander as outcasts;
but as Messengers of Peace they have visited every
clime; they have raised their temples and cities in
every land, subjected to one power only&mdash;the insatiate
monster of the earth, Time&mdash;the twin-born with
Creation, and who will be the last mourner of Nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and her name! Yet even when their children have
been struck down&mdash;like Niobe's, by the shafts of fate&mdash;still
how beautiful in Ruins! Although prostrate upon
the earth, yet even in death, they have voices as
speaking from the tomb:&mdash;but the Parents still live
on, ever young and immortal, and can point to the
proud remains of their fallen Children, and with the
voice of historic truth proclaim their fadeless epitaph
and character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Egypt!</span> My first-born and consort of the Nile!&mdash;while
thy Pyramids and Temples shall remain&mdash;and
they will even to the final tempest of the World&mdash;thou
shalt be identified from among all the nations of the
Earth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Athens!</span>&mdash;My favourite daughter! Until the Rock
of the Acropolis shall fall,&mdash;thy classic beauties,&mdash;around
which have gleamed the meridian splendour
of the mind, will proclaim that Minerva, Plato, Pericles,
and Phidias, were thy own!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palmyra!</span>&mdash;My third joy! Although the wild
Arab sleeps within thy roofless dwelling, with the
whirling sands for his nightly mantle&mdash;yet, while thy
Porticoes, Arches, and Colonnades shall be seen, the
City of the Desert will live in Memory; for the Spirits
of Longinus and Zenobia will be there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rome!</span>&mdash;My Warrior Son! Thy ancient glory
lives in the recorded evidences of thy Parent's Art;
for amid the ruined columns of thy Forum glide the
spectral forms of Romulus, Junius, Virginius, Brutus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Cato, and of Cicero! Through thy Arches move
those of Septimus, Vespasian, Titus, and of Constantine!&mdash;And
dost thou not speak to all the world from
the solemn historic voice of thy giant Coliseum? But
beyond all this, from the ashes of thy former magnificence&mdash;like
the Ph&oelig;nix upon the spot of Martyrdom,
thou hast risen in double splendour to the Glory of
<span class="smcap">THE Saviour</span> and the Faith of an Apostle; and to the
triple-fame of Bramante, Raphael, and Angelo!</p>

<p>These are the still-living metropolitan records of by-gone
days&mdash;from the Heathen to the Christian&mdash;they
cannot be rejected&mdash;from them we trace and prove the
æras of the world.</p>

<p>Sculpture has also her own prerogative, apart and
separate from her Lord, as a dower-right, a jointure
power of instruction; and what immortal pupils has
she not produced? They stand as the models of art
and intellect&mdash;each unapproached&mdash;solitary and beautiful,&mdash;the
human eye contemplates them with the
chaste wonder of Creation's daughter&mdash;Eve, when
from the banks of Eden's limpid waters, she first gazed
upon the mirrored image of herself! The Jupiter of
Elias,&mdash;the Minerva and the Triple-Fates of the Parthenon,&mdash;the
Medicean Venus and her sister of the
Bath,&mdash;the gentle Antinöus,&mdash;the Athenian Phocian,&mdash;The
Pythonian Victor&mdash;Sun-clad Apollo,&mdash;the Serpent-strangled
Priest and Sons of Troy, all speak the
intellectual power of their mistress: and even the
poor Roman captive&mdash;the death-struck Gladiator&mdash;has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
been raised by her magic wand from the sandy deathbed
of the Coliseum, to live on, unconquered to all
posterity!</p>

<p>Sculpture is a title not only applicable to statuary,
but to every kind of architectural stone-ornament, and
in every stage towards its completion&mdash;from the rough-quarried
block to the polished marbles of the frieze
and pediment: this being admitted, how vast and
almost unlimited is the field for historic contemplation!
The Antiquary when he removes the trodden earth
from the mouldering tomb to trace the deeds of heroes:
or from an antique Gem or Medal, raises to light from
beneath the dark dust of ages, the bold outline of an imperial
head: or, when within the lava-coloured city, a
hidden statue from beneath the veil of centuries bursts
upon his bewildered sight, he still remembers that
Sculpture was the creative power. The traveller who
pauses in silent wonder as he views the Egyptian
Pyramids (blocks of stone raised to perpetuate a nameless
king), turns with redoubled pleasure to contemplate
the sculptured marble of Tentyra&mdash;in the sight of
whose shrines the followers of Napoleon felt amply
repaid "for the dangers they had passed." Although
the Assyrian Kings have for ages been covered with
the sands of their desert, and the wandering Arab
sleeps unmolested in the shade of Palmyra's columns,
unconscious of his mighty mansion, yet her temples
and porticoes speak loudly for the living truth of historic
marble.</p>

<p>Greece!&mdash;the wonder of the classic age,&mdash;the key-stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in the arch of intellect,&mdash;owes her glory to
Marathon and Salamis, but her living name breathes
from the Sculpture of the Acropolis. The proportion
given by Ictinus to the body of the Parthenon is fast
falling to decay, while the sculptured mantle of Phidias
which adorns it adds regality to splendour, and every
stone that falls produces but another graceful fold to
the gorgeous drapery! Sculpture still preserves Syracuse
amid the wreck of time, as when Marcellus
wept tears of joy at beholding his mighty conquest:
it still points out Carthage, the fatherland of Hannibal,
as when Marius upon a prostrate column mourned
her desolation. Mysterious Pæstum has no other
monument, for her deeds have perished with her records.
From Istria to Dalmatia may be traced the
historic progress of the art,&mdash;the gate of the Sergii,
Theatre of Pola, and the Palace of Dioclesian, whose
columned wall is mirrored in the Adriatic, all bear
convincing testimony. And for ancient Rome!&mdash;it is
her living history! The Statorian columns of the
Forum, lifting high their leafy brows, proclaim the
spot where Romulus checked the bold advance of the
Sabine Tatius: the solitary shaft of Corinthian form
and grace, gives fame to Phocas: the Ionic columns
of Concordia's Temple, proudly point the place where
Cicero impeached the blood-stained Catiline; while the
triumvirate columns of the Tonans-Jupiter preserve
the imperial name that witnessed <span class="smcap">the Redeemer's</span>
Birth! The arch of Titus (where the Composite
first shone forth) heralds the Conquest of Jerusalem,&mdash;its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
sculpture, a Jewish basilisk, for none of that
nation dare pass beneath its gateway. The arch of
Constantine, robed in Sculptured history, records the
battle with Maxentius, the first victory beneath the
Banner of the Cross, and gained by the Christian Prince
after his conversion by the vision of the Holy-sign!
The column of Antoninus still preserves the deeds of
the philosophic Marcus; and while the equestrian
statue of the Capitoline Hill presents the figure of
Aurelius, the grouped trophies of Marius make known
the conquest of the Cimbri! The column of Trajanus
blazons forth the wars of the Dacii, thereby
transmitting to all ages the costume and weapons of
the captives, and of the imperial victors. The circular
and columned edifice speaks of Vesta,&mdash;her Virgins,
and the heathen's perpetual altar-flame: the giant
arches near the Forum, of a Temple to the God of
Peace, while the earth-buried palace of the Esquiline
contained the moving form of that Son of War, who
fell beneath the patriot blow of Brutus! The Pantheon,&mdash;the
Pyramid,&mdash;and the Tower,&mdash;perpetuate
Agrippa, Cestius, and Mætella's fame! The triple-monument
of the Appian-Way, tells the historic tale
of the first victory that consolidated Rome in early
freedom,&mdash;it speaks of the Curiatian Brothers who
fell for Alba,&mdash;of the Horatii that fell for Rome:&mdash;the
classic eye in viewing those time-honoured tombs
looks through a vista of near three thousand years,&mdash;it
gazes upon the Horatian triumph and his spoils,&mdash;it
sees a widowed sister's upraised hands in malediction,&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
beholds that sister's death from a brother's patriot
sword! A sculptured frieze and cornice upon a lone
pilastered house, in the most humble street of Rome,
speak to the passer-by that within those shattered walls
once dwelt the "Last of the Tribunes," Petrarch's
friend&mdash;renowned Rienzi! Then the blood-cemented
Coliseum! It is an history within itself!
Commencing with its founders, Vespasian and Titus,
and its builders, the poor captives from Jerusalem,&mdash;it
encloses all the savage and succeeding emperors whose
mantles of coronation were there dyed in human
gore! Domitian, Commodus, Valerian, and the long
line of insatiate murderers of the early Christians!
And even Trajan suffered the sands of that arena to
receive the mangled body of an Apostle's Minister,&mdash;Ignatius
of Antioch,&mdash;who died like Polycarp of
Smyrna, for that Faith which claimed death in cruel
torments rather than Apostacy,&mdash;from whose lips may
have passed the same sentiment as from his successor
in martyrdom: "Eighty and six years have I served
Him, and He has done me no injury: how then can I
blaspheme my King and my <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>?" Architecture
erected the Coliseum, but Sculpture like a funeral
pall, mantles this human slaughterhouse of Rome;&mdash;not
a stone of which, from the base to the ruined cornice,
but has an historic voice that speaks, as from the
Arimathean Sepulchre of our Religion, of the final
Resurrection of those early martyrs to the Faith of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>!</p>

<p>The humble gravestone of the village churchyard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
is received as legal evidence of death,&mdash;it speaks a
name, a date, and burial,&mdash;the Acropolis, as the tomb
of Athens, can do no more, save that it is the record of
a nation's downfall, and not a peasant's.</p>

<p>Sculpture can speak even of the Religious mind of
the deceased,&mdash;bring it to memory, and instruct us as
to the means whereby the departed attained his hope
of Salvation,&mdash;it presents the transparent medium
through which he gazed upon futurity, and believed
in his approach to God: for the Cross or Crescent
upon a tombstone, needs no other language to inform
the passer-by, that the departed was a follower of
Christ or Mahomet! If then the mind of a solitary
corpse can, as it were again be vivified, by merely
contemplating the sculptured emblem of the dead, and
that from a single gravestone, may not entire nations
be historically resuscitated, when the human eye and
mind are brought to gaze upon, and investigate whole
Cities of Ruins, with their sculptured Temples, Tombs,
and Palaces? Yes! though they should be found
amid the darkened forests of the Western Continent,
where the panther and beasts of prey were thought
alone to dwell. Yes! Palenque, Copan, Chiapas, and
their muraled sisters, have historic voices for posterity
from their "cities of the dead," the Pompeii and
the Herculaneii of the Western Hemisphere,&mdash;yet more
aged and venerable than even those victims of Vesuvius!</p>

<p>Architecture and Sculpture then claim the right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
be received as undeniable evidences of historical record;
and, as such, those two branches of the Fine
Arts will be admitted by the reader in support, and in
illustration of the Epoch now under investigation.
Ictinus, Phidias, and Praxiteles,&mdash;Bramante, Jones,
and Wren,&mdash;Canova, Chantrey, and Greenough, may
justly be regarded as historians; for from the volumes
of their art, events and æras can be traced and established.</p>


<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<h4>PAINTING.</h4>

<p>Painting,&mdash;the most beautiful in the triumvirate of
the Arts, proudly follows Sculpture in her classic path,&mdash;the
precedence only yielded as to one of elder birth,
who attired in her snow-white raiment marches forward
with majestic step, casting her shadow to the
confines of History; while her graceful follower, clad
in the rainbow-tinted garments, and having no shadow
of herself, receives her coloured brilliancy from the
glowing Sun of Genius, and thence in gratitude reflects
back her pictorial light to illuminate the mind! This
delightful art may be defined to be a species of poetic
and historic writing, and subservient to the same ends&mdash;the
expression of ideas and events&mdash;of Nature and
her children. It bears resemblance to the diamond in
the dark recesses of the earth, which by its own innate
quality emits sparkling rays of light, thereby not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
discovering its own splendour, but giving a lustre to
obscurity.</p>

<p>Painting has her direct claims to be received as
authority for past events and records, and in illustration
may be cited the Life and History of the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>.
The pictorial art alone was for centuries the only record
whereby the mass of the people could read that
Sacred Life. The cross upon the banners, shields, and
pennons of the Crusaders, spoke to the Christian heart,
even above the din of arms or the yell of battle. When
the Latin was the general tongue of prayer and preaching,
the pictorial art sprung into life with redoubled
power; and from the painting above the altar, representing
the Crucifixion, the people learned that Christ
suffered,&mdash;it alone reached the heart and understanding,
while the Latin language reached only the ears of
the unlettered. Has not the Life of the Redeemer
been traced through every event by the painter's magic
art? The Annunciation, Nativity, Disputation in the
Temple, Healing the Sick and the Blind, Last Supper
and Sacrament, Rejection by Pilate, Crucifixion, and
the Resurrection and Transfiguration, are the pictorial
Volumes of our religion. Angelo, De Vinci, Raphael,
Murillo, Rubens, and West, were as essentially historians
of sacred events,&mdash;as Plutarch, Livy, Tacitus,
Gibbon, Hume, and Robertson, were those of a national
and political character.</p>

<p>Painting has traced upon the galleries of Versailles
the chief events of the French kingdom&mdash;of the Empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and its glory. And in the present day, the new
walls of England's Parliament are to be decorated with
her deeds of chivalry&mdash;sacred to her historic and undying
fame!</p>

<p>The walls of the American capital contain the imperishable
history of Washington, and the Freedom of
the Western Hemisphere! Paintings then will not be
rejected as evidences of events, or of religious and national
records.</p>


<h3>SECTION III.</h3>

<h4>COINS AND MEDALS.</h4>

<p>These are admitted species of historic evidence, and
as lasting ones, perhaps, beyond all others. A series
of them is the most certain method of arranging a
chronological tablet, and thereby preserving the data
of history, mythology, portraits, customs, and art.</p>

<p>The reader will excuse the relation of an anecdote,
to which may be traced the production of the present
work. At the early age of nine years, a small ancient
coin came into the accidental possession of the writer;
its stamp and character were enveloped in mystery,
and recourse was had to an antiquary to decipher
them. The obverse of the coin contained a profile
head, and around it the letters <span class="antiqua">AVGVSTVS</span>: on the
reverse, a Temple with the doors closed, surmounted
by the word <span class="antiqua">PROVIDENTIA</span>. The explanation was
as follows: viz.&mdash;A coin of Augustus Cæsar&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Temple was that of Janus, the doors of which had
been <em>open</em> for nearly two centuries, as emblematical of
the continuance of Roman warfare with foreign countries;
but on the coin the doors were <em>closed</em>, and with
the word of thanksgiving, were symbolical of universal
peace, thus proving that the coin was struck the
very year in which the Saviour was born! Thus
upon one coin were illustrated the features of the
second Roman Emperor,&mdash;Mythology, Cessation of
War,&mdash;the downfall of Brutus and Cassius,&mdash;the defeat
of Anthony,&mdash;and the Birth of Christianity! This
simple incident made so powerful an impression upon
the boyhood of the relator, that to it he has always
traced the foundation of his Scriptural, Historical, and
Poetical studies, together with an enthusiastic devotion
to the Fine Arts.</p>

<p>The description of the above coin will illustrate the
historical intelligence to be derived from their perusal.
A medal is an especial mode of recording tributary honour
to individuals&mdash;literary, civil, or military;&mdash;they
become heirlooms in family possessions, and are transmitted
from sire to son, as absolute records of their
ancestors' fame. They are also struck in celebration of
national events, and thence become records of a people.
So assured was Napoleon of this, that a series of
his medals are a complete history of his victories, from
his Consulate to his loss of the Empire; and that event
at Waterloo was recorded by Great Britain upon her
medals, for even the soldiers as well as officers. Denon
of France, and Wyon of England, are names as artists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
worthy to record the victories of Napoleon and
Wellington.</p>

<p>Architecture, Sculpture, Paintings, Coins, and Medals,
from the investigation contained in the previous pages
(we submit to the judgment of the reader), are established
as authorities for historical records.</p>


<h3>SECTION IV.</h3>

<h4>ENGRAVED GEMS.</h4>

<p>This is a branch of the Fine Arts, the most ancient
in practice&mdash;or that is mentioned in history, sacred or
profane; and although gems are not received like coins
or medals, as conclusive proofs of events, yet they
cannot be rejected on the score of doubtful antiquity.
Seals and signet-rings are of course included in the
term "engraved gems," and they bear the heraldic
arms of family honours, their names and actions are
traceable, and thus they illustrate the chivalric dignities
of the original owners. The style of ancient art
(even without a date to the gem) will carry the inquiring
mind to the æra of the artist, and thence establish
at least the century in which they were engraved.</p>

<p>Of the antiquity of gem engraving, the Bible bears
conclusive evidence. In the graphic description of
the priestly garments of Aaron, [Exodus xxviii.] it
states that the shoulder ornaments of the Ephod are
to be engraved stones, each containing six of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
names of the Tribes of Israel. "And thou shalt take
two onyx stones and <em>grave</em> on them the names of the
Children of Israel: six of their names on one stone,
and the other six names of the rest on the other stone,
according to their birth. With the work of <em>an engraver</em>
in stone, <em>like the engravings of a signet</em>, shalt
thou <em>engrave</em> the two stones with the names of the
Children of Israel," &amp;c. (verses 9, 10, and 11.)</p>

<p>Aaron's "breastplate of judgment" was to contain
twelve precious stones or gems, each stone to have engraved
upon it the name of a Tribe of Israel. "And
thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of
stones: the first row shall be a sardius (<em>i. e.</em> ruby), a
topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.
And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire,
and a diamond. And the third row a ligure, an agate,
and an amethyst. And the fourth row a beryl, and an
onyx, and a jaspar: they shall be set in gold in their
enclosings. And the stones shall be with the names of
the Children of Israel, twelve, according to their names,
<em>like the engravings of a signet</em>: every one with his
name shall they be according to the twelve tribes."
(v. 17&mdash;21.)</p>

<p>The gold mitre for the High Priest is thus described:
"And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave
upon it, like <em>the engravings of a signet</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Holiness To
the Lord</span>"&mdash;(v. 36). From the triplicated sentence in
the above quotations&mdash;viz., "like the engravings of a
signet," it is proved that gem engraving was practised
<em>anterior</em> to the time of Aaron, who officiated 1491<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
years before Christ. The great antiquity, therefore, of
sculptured gems, will not be questioned; and their
mottoes, ciphers, or style of art, may speak of a people,
their epochs, or their progress in civilization.</p>

<p>In the development of the present work, every
branch of the Fine Arts will be brought forward to uphold
and substantiate this Tyrian Æra&mdash;they having all
obtained in the Western hemisphere previous to the
time of Columbus,&mdash;which period (anterior to the
Genoese, 1492, <small>A. D.</small>) is contemplated by the new historic
term&mdash;<em>Ancient America</em>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">THE DISCOVERIES OF THE RUINED CITIES IN MEXICAN AMERICA&mdash;THEIR
GENERAL CHARACTER AND GEOGRAPHICAL
LOCALITIES&mdash;THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE RUINS ANALYZED,
&amp;c.</p></blockquote>


<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<h4>THE DISCOVERERS AND EXPLORERS OF THE RUINS&mdash;DATE AND
LOCALITY&mdash;PAINTINGS&mdash;MAPS AND CHARTS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>In the preceding chapter, it is stated that the Fine
Arts will be used as strong evidences towards the development
of this epoch, and that they will be received
as records. They represent what will be wanted
in illustrating the Aborigines of the North&mdash;viz.,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">the lex scripta</i>&mdash;for Sculpture and Paintings must be
regarded only as a more concise and impressive manner
of writing. Since, therefore, Sculpture is one of
the powers conjoined with Architecture to enable us to
raise our historical edifice, it is necessary to prove the
existence of our strength in the country illustrated&mdash;to
prove that Ancient Cities have been discovered&mdash;that
temples and palaces have been recovered from the
depths of the forest, and that, too, in that part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
America now under consideration, having reference to
the Aborigines <em>not</em> of the North. These investigations
are required for the reader who may not have read
"The Incidents of Travel in Central America," and
even those that have, will expect an analysis or review
of the discovered Ruins; it is also demanded by the
character of this work, for it is essential to establish
their existence before they can be produced as witnesses
to support an historic argument; and like a legal
document, parole evidence will not be received if the
document itself can be produced.</p>

<p>Paintings also are a portion of the evidence to sustain
our novel history. The paintings of Mexican
America, though rude, contain proofs of progressive
ages, whereby facts may be gathered, supported by
traditions, to authorize the formation of a chronological
arrangement of events. These pictorial efforts
of art are on cloth of unusual thickness, in order to
secure stability&mdash;for the Mexicans had no other written
records&mdash;but, to which may now be added from
the late discoveries&mdash;Sculpture. The paintings, it has
been stated, were rude, and not unlike those of ancient
Egypt; and like those of the Nile, a symbol stood for
whole sentences, or parts of history,&mdash;and does not the
same method exist with European art? A cross represents
the Crucifixion! It is in this manner that
the paintings of ancient Mexico must be translated.
The colouring was far beyond the Egyptian in regard
to brilliancy and variety&mdash;an important point in proving
a Tyrian analogy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spaniards, at their conquest of Mexico, burnt
in the public market-place, pyramids of paintings, the
designs of which are even lost to history; yet many
others were subsequently preserved, and now adorn
the royal libraries of Bologna, Madrid, and the Vatican.
The National Library of England contains a
vellum folio copy of the splendid work by Lord Kingsborough
upon these paintings, forming, in the seven
volumes, a collection of all the pictorial relics of ancient
Mexico.</p>

<p>The skill of the Mexican painters was extended to
another branch of writing, in which nautical science
claimed a share&mdash;viz., Maps and Charts. This important
fact will be enlarged upon in the analogies. These
few remarks are only inserted in order to sustain a
consecutive arrangement of evidence, for the reader
must already have known of the existence of these
paintings, though not of their novel application.</p>

<p>The several discoveries of the ruined cities will now
be reviewed and established. In the ancient capital of
the Mexican Empire, it has been stated, that the
Spaniards acted the character of incendiaries. In
1520, every available specimen of Mexican art was
consumed by Cortez and the priests. Paintings, the
only manuscripts of the Mexican nation, were destroyed,
and became a bonfire for the soldiery&mdash;every
palace and temple of the capital was levelled to the
earth, and the foundation of the first cathedral of the
invaders was laid with thousands of statues&mdash;the idols
of the Aborigines. Every vestige of the Mexican records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
was supposed to have been consumed, broken, or
buried.</p>

<p>After a lapse of 270 years, two statues were dug up
in the grand <em>plaza</em> of the modern city of Mexico; but
from the interest felt for these religious relics by the
poor descendants of the Aborigines, the Spaniards secretly
buried them, it was said, in the garden-court of
a Convent. At the same time (1790) was exhumed
a circular piece of sculpture, having reference to the
astronomical calendar of the ancient inhabitants. This
is still preserved in Mexico, and is quoted, and a drawing
given by the illustrious Humboldt in his work
upon that country: it will be referred to in the analogies.</p>

<p>A brief review of the discovery of the Ruins and
their locality will now be required. From a record by
Huarros of Guatimala, and that on the authority of
Fuentes, the ruins of Copan were known in 1700.
Palenque was visited by Del Rio; and by Dupaix about
1805. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, the
scientific Humboldt visited Mexico; he obtained drawings
of the ruins of Mitla, in the Province of Oaxaca,
and others of a similar character, but especially the
terraced-pyramid of Cholula, which he visited. The
investigations were published by the same scholastic
traveller. At a later period, Uxmal (Yucatan) was
explored under a commission of the Spanish Government
by Waldeck; his work (folio) is most beautifully
illustrated. In compliment to the nobleman
who published the great work on the Ancient Mexican
Paintings, he called one of the ruins, <em>The Pyramid of</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<em>Kingsborough</em>&mdash;an anachronism, perhaps, allowable
when the motive is considered. Copan was visited by
Galindo in 1836; but he lacked the perseverance necessary
for a perfect exploration. This latter desideratum
was fully evinced by Stephens and Catherwood
who, in 1839-40, visited and explored all of the above
(excepting those seen by Baron Humboldt), and several
cities before unknown in general history. As a geographical
position, the localities of these dead cities are between
the capital of Mexico and the Isthmus of Darien, but
chiefly in Guatimala; on the borders of Yucatan, and
on that Peninsula; they therefore occupy the narrow
part of the Continent between the two great oceans.
A reference to the map of Central America, will aid
the following remarks:</p>

<p>The river Montagua empties itself into the Bay of
Honduras, at or near, Omoa; approaching the source
of this river, it branches off to the South, which branch
is called Copan River; above the rapids of this branch-river,
is situated on the banks the now celebrated
ruined City of Copan, over <em>two miles</em> in extant, parallel
with the stream. Palenque is nearer Mexico. The
ruins of Uxmal are in Yucatan. From the Architectural
characteristics of the edifices, we find no difficulty
in arranging the order of their being built, which, with
all due respect for the opinion of others, we submit to
be as follows: viz.&mdash;first, the city of Copan, then Cholula,
followed by Quirigua, Tecpan-Guatimala, Quiché,
Gueguetinango, Ocosingo, Mitla, Palenque, and lastly,
Uxmal: and about the same period of building, the
cities of Chi-Chen, Zayi, Kabah, Espita, and Ticol,&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
last being in the Peninsula of Yucatan.
Compared with these relics of past centuries, we consider
the City of Mexico to be of comparatively modern
date, <em>at the time of the Spanish conquest</em> (<small>A. D.</small>
1520).</p>

<p>The Ruins necessary to be described for the illustration
of our present subject, will be those of Copan,
Palenque, and Uxmal; and for this purpose extracts
will be quoted from the lately-published work on Central
America, by Mr. Stephens. These extracts will
be given as unquestionable authority, and the engravings
in the work will be received as accurate representation
of the Ruins, and upon which many of our results
have been founded. On the subject of their
accuracy, the fascinating traveller writes as follows:</p>

<p>"I will only remark, that from the beginning our
great object and effort was to procure <em>true copies of
the originals</em>, adding nothing for effect as pictures.
Mr. Catherwood made the outline of all the drawings
with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">camera lucida</i> and divided his paper into
sections, so as to preserve the utmost accuracy of proportion.
The engravings were made with the same
regard to truth, from drawings reduced by Mr. C. himself&mdash;the
originals being also in the hands of the engraver.
Proofs of every plate were given to Mr. C.,
who made such corrections as were necessary: and in
my opinion they are as true copies as can be presented;
and except the stones themselves the reader
cannot have better materials for <em>speculation and
study</em>."</p>

<p>Though this candid traveller acknowledges not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
know the principles of Architecture, or the rules of
Art, and when in Egypt amused himself by mutilating
a statue of Isis,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> yet when he came in sight of buried
cities in his own country, before unknown to the history
of the world, the Sculpture of which is "as fine
as that of Egypt,"&mdash;feelings he must have had of
which no man would rob him,&mdash;reputation by being
the explorer, of which an enemy would not attempt
to deprive him,&mdash;and although we are not selfish
enough to covet his reputation, yet we are candid
enough to admit that we have, from the heart, envied
him his feelings!</p>

<p>He has given indeed by his pen, and the artist by
his pencil, a reflection of the Ruins, but it is from a
mirror of polished ebony, simply a <em>fac-simile</em> resemblance,&mdash;light
and shade only,&mdash;a specimen of Daguerreotype!
No one can mistake the rapid manner
in which the true copy is impressed upon the mind,
and that by the most easy and agreeable means&mdash;viz.,
the fascination of his style; but the <em>colouring of life</em>
is not there,&mdash;<em>the Soul of History is wanting</em>! The
Promethean spark by which the flame of historic
truth should illuminate his work, and be viewed as a
gleaming beacon from afar, to direct wanderers
through the dark night of wonders, has found no spot
to rest upon and to vivify! But this he has done,&mdash;he
has brought the timbers of the historic bark to
view:&mdash;research must build, and science place the
rudder; the pilot, constant as the northern star; enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
must drive her before the wind, every sail
set, fore and aft, aloft, abroad and full, and it will be
strange indeed if that spark will not be found upon
Truth's phosphoric sea!</p>

<p>If these Ruins can be identified with a nation of the
ancient world,&mdash;<em>ancient</em> world?&mdash;the first word is
superfluous now, for these discoveries have destroyed
the opposite phrase,&mdash;<em>new</em> world;&mdash;that expression
will belong hereafter to England and parts of Europe,
not America; for the former date from the first
Cæsar,&mdash;the latter, if we err not, from an older and a
greater conqueror! If, we say, these Ruins can be
identified with a country of Asia, and of "the olden
time," we shall have no regret for having turned
shipwright to aid the discovery of that nation; and if
our classic galley should founder ere we reach "the
point proposed," we shall at least struggle in the
buoyant waves of hope and pleasure, our light heart
floating above the waters of disappointment; and with
joyous pride will we hail those who in passing by have
found and steered a truer track!</p>

<p>First will be given a description of such parts of the
great Ruins as may be necessary in the author's own
words, with such commentaries as may be required by
the narration: then will follow Mr. Stephens's reflections
upon all the Ruins; his arguments will be met,
his errors detected, his contradictions investigated, and
thereupon we shall endeavour (at least) to completely
refute his deductions and conclusions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<h4>THE RUINS OF COPAN.</h4>

<p>"They are in the district of country now known as
the state of Honduras, one of the most fertile valleys
of Central America." Their precise locality was
stated in the last section, with the exception that their
distance from the sea is about "three hundred miles."</p>

<p>"The Copan river is not navigable, even for canoes,
except for a short distance in the rainy season."</p>

<p>This is a description of the River now (1843), and
not as it may have appeared at the time of erecting
the edifices.</p>

<p>"Falls intercept its course before it empties into the
Montagua."</p>

<p>As a principle of military defence the site was well
chosen, for the barrier of the falls would prevent the
approach of an enemy to the city by the river from
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>"The extent of the Ruins along the river, as ascertained
by monuments still found, is <em>more than two
miles</em>. There is one monument (or ruin) on the opposite
side of the river, at the distance of a mile, on the
top of a mountain two thousand feet high. Whether
the city ever crossed the river, and extended to that
monument it is impossible to say; I believe not."</p>

<p>So do we,&mdash;and that belief instructs us in the seeming
fact of another means of military defence; for from
the locality and height of the mountain it is almost
evident that the "monument" was used as a watch-tower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and consequently from that elevated point a
complete view was obtained of all the approaches to
the city. These facts illustrate (seemingly at least)
that the Aborigines had a knowledge of military security
as well as that of architecture; and as we believe
that Copan was the first city built in the Western
Hemisphere, these considerations will be of importance
in identifying. The reader will understand ("once
for all") that no hint, even the most remote, is derived
from Mr. Stephens's work (or any other) towards
the formation of our Theory, or the establishing of
this Epoch,&mdash;on the contrary, he distinctly asserts
(vol. ii., p. 442),</p>

<p>"I shall not attempt to inquire into the origin of
this people, from what country they came, or when, or
how; I shall confine myself to their works and their
ruins."</p>

<p>Our artistical or historical comments, good, bad, or
indifferent, are our own, and accompany the quotations
for the purpose of supporting the Analogies in a subsequent
chapter. The italicised and bracketed words
the reader will give especial attention to;&mdash;as we have
so expressed them for facility in illustrating.</p>

<p>"There are no remains in Copan of palaces or private
dwellings, and the principal part (of the ruins) is
that which stands on the bank of the river, and may
perhaps with propriety be called the Temple. The
Temple is an oblong enclosure. The front or river
wall ('stone and nearly <em>one hundred feet high</em>,' vol.
i., p. 95) extends on a right line, North and South,
<em>six hundred and twenty-four feet</em>, and it is from <em>sixty</em> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<em>ninety feet in height</em>." The difference in height
arising from several parts having fallen. "It (the
river-wall) is made of <em>cut stone</em>, from three to six feet
in length, and a foot and a half in breadth. In many
places the stones have been thrown down by bushes
growing out of the crevices. The other three sides
consist of ranges of steps and <em>pyramidal</em> structures,
rising from <em>thirty, to one hundred and forty feet</em> on a
slope. The whole line of survey (of this Temple) is <em>two
thousand eight hundred and sixty-six feet</em>, which
though gigantic and extraordinary for a ruined structure
of the Aborigines, <em>that the reader's imagination
may not mislead him</em>, I consider it necessary to say, <em>is
not so large</em> as the great (Egyptian) Pyramid of
Ghizeh."</p>

<p>We certainly do not desire to be misled, or <em>our</em>
readers either,&mdash;therefore, at once, will be compared
the measurements of the pyro-temple of Copan, and
the Pyramid of Egypt. Lee Bruyn gives the base
side of the great edifice of the Nile at 750 feet.
Greaves states it to be 693 feet; the difference between
these computations is fifty-seven feet, which
divided for an average, and added to the lesser sum,
will shew one side to be 721 feet (and a fraction),
which multiplied by four, the sum total of the entire
square base will be 2884 feet,&mdash;that of Copan&mdash;viz.,
2866 feet, will leave only a difference between the
great Pyramidal Edifices in Egypt and Copan of
<em>eighteen feet</em>! but from diversity in measurement
they may be viewed as the fac-similes of each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in regard to the base. This cannot be accidental.
Taking Greaves's numbers, each side 693 × 4 = 2772
feet. Stephens's sum total of Copan is 2866, leaving
an increase in size over that of the Egyptian of
ninety-four feet! Mr. Stephens may, perhaps, have
forgotten the measurements in Egypt, although he has
travelled there; but we shall have occasion to refer to
the ingenious manner in which he endeavours to stay
the "imagination" of his readers upon the subject of
all the Ruins.</p>

<p>The comparative measurements have been brought
forward, that the reader may not be misled in reading
this work.</p>

<p>Another singular coincidence (we may remark) occurs
in the measurement of the terraced-pyramid at
Mexican Cholula; the base of that is 5760 feet!&mdash;now
the base of the Egyptian, as shewn above, is 2884 feet
only; this sum multiplied by two, produces a sum total
of 5768; a difference only of <em>eight feet</em>, would make the
Pyramid of Cholula <em>exactly twice</em> as large as that of
Egypt. An error may have occurred in reference to
the eight feet&mdash;for in so large a measurement, and by
different authors, it is but natural that an error might
arise, and consequently these bases, as to size, cannot
be viewed as accidental.</p>

<p>"Near the South-west corner of the river-wall, and
the South-wall, is a recess, which was probably once
occupied by <em>a colossal monument</em> fronting the water&mdash;no
part of which is now visible. Beyond are the remains
of <em>two small pyramidal structures</em>, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
largest of which is attached a wall running along the
west bank of the river. This appears to have been
one of the principal walls of the city, and between the
<em>two pyramids</em> there seems to have been a gateway or
principal entrance from the water. The South wall
runs at right angles to the river, beginning with a
range of steps about thirty feet high, and each step
about eighteen inches square. At the South-east corner
is <em>a massive pyramidal structure</em> one hundred and
twenty feet high on the slope. On the right are other
remains of terraces and <em>pyramidal buildings</em>, and here,
also, was probably a gateway, by a passage about
twenty feet wide, into a quadrangular area two hundred
and fifty feet square, <em>two sides of which are massive
pyramids</em> one hundred and twenty feet on the
slope. At the foot of these structures, and at different
parts of the quadrangular area, are numerous remains
of <em>sculpture</em>, especially a <em>colossal monument, richly
sculptured</em>, fallen and ruined. Behind it <em>fragments of
sculpture</em>, thrown down from their places by trees, are
strewed and lying loose <em>on the side of the pyramid,
from the base to the top</em>. 'Idols' give a peculiar character
to the ruins of Copan. One stands with its
face <em>to the East</em> [<em>i. e.</em> to the Rising Sun] about six feet
from the base of the pyramidal wall. It is <em>thirteen
feet high, four feet in front and back</em>, and <em>three feet
on the sides</em> [<em>i. e.</em> four-sided column] <em>sculptured on all
four of its sides, from the base to the top</em>, and one of
the richest and most elaborate specimens in the whole
extent of ruins. Originally, it was <em>painted</em>, the marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of <em>red colour</em> being distinctly visible. Before it at the
distance of about eight feet, is a large block of sculptured
stone, which the Indians call an altar. The
subject of the front [<em>i. e.</em> of the Idol-obelisk] is a full-length
figure, the face wanting beard, and of a feminine
cast, though the dress seems that of a man. On
the two sides are rows of <em>hieroglyphics</em> [<em>i. e.</em> the sacred
or religious language] which probably recite the
history of this mysterious personage. Following the
wall, is another monument or idol of the same size,
and in many respects similar. The character of this
image as it stands at the foot of the pyramidal structure,
with masses of fallen stone [ruins] resting against
its base, is grand, and it would be difficult to exceed
the <em>richness of the ornament and sharpness of the
sculpture</em>. This, too, was <em>painted</em>, and the <em>red</em>is still
distinctly visible. The whole quadrangle is overgrown
with trees, and interspersed with <em>fragments</em> of <em>fine
sculpture</em>, particularly on the <em>East side</em> [<em>i. e.</em> to the
Rising Sun.] At the North-east corner is a narrow
passage, which was probably a third gateway. On
the right is a confused range of terraces running off
into the forest. Turning Northward, the range to the
left-hand continues <em>a high massive pyramidal structure</em>,
with trees growing out of it to the very top. At
a short distance is <em>a detached pyramid about fifty feet</em>
<small>SQUARE</small>, and thirty feet high. The range of structures
turns at right angles to the left, and runs to the river,
joining the other extremity of the wall, at which we
began our survey. The bank was elevated about thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
feet above the river, <em>and had been protected by a wall
of stone</em>, most of which had fallen down."</p>

<p>The city-wall on the river-side, with its raised bank,
and making allowances for what had fallen from the
top of the great wall, must then have ranged from <em>one
hundred and thirty, to one hundred and fifty feet in
height</em>!</p>

<p>"<em>There was no entire pyramid</em>, but at most two or
three pyramidal sides, and <em>then joined</em> on to terraces
or other structures of the same kind."</p>

<p>The first line of this last quotation is distinctly contradicted
a few lines before it&mdash;for he says, "At a short
distance is a <em>detached</em> pyramid about fifty feet <em>square</em>."
Therefore this is an "entire pyramid." That of Cholula
stands "solitary and alone" in a large plain, and there,
at least, is an "entire pyramid," so far as its base and
sides are considered.</p>

<p>"Beyond the wall of enclosure were walls, terraces,
and pyramidal elevations running off into the forest,
which sometimes confused us. Probably the whole
was not erected at the same time, but additions were
made, and statues erected by different kings, or perhaps
in commemoration of important events in the history
of the city. Along the whole line were ranges of
<em>steps</em> with <em>pyramidal</em> elevations, probably crowned on
the top with buildings or altars, now in ruins. <em>All
these steps and the pyramidal sides were painted</em> [red],
and the reader may imagine the effect when the whole
country was clear of forest, and priests and people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
were ascending from the outside of the terraces, and
thence to the holy places within to pay their adoration
in the Temple.</p>

<p>"Within this enclosure are two rectangular courtyards,
having ranges of steps ascending to terraces.
The area of each is about forty feet from the river.
On one side at the foot of the pyramidal wall is another
monument or idol, [<em>i. e.</em> sculptured obelisk].
It is about the same height as the others (in all fourteen),
but differs in shape, being larger at top than
below. Its appearance and character are tasteful and
pleasing."</p>

<p>We desire to call the particular attention of the
reader to the following piece of sculpture, as it will
hold a conspicuous position as we advance in this
volume.</p>

<p>"Near this [idol last mentioned] is a <em>remarkable
altar</em>, which perhaps presents as curious a subject for
speculation as any monument at Copan. The altars,
like the idols, are all of a single block of stone. In
general, they are not so richly ornamented, and are
more faded and worn, or covered with moss. All
differed in fashion, and doubtless had some distinct and
peculiar reference to the idols before which they
stood."</p>

<p>Each of the idols, therefore, had an altar before it,
and each of the altars had its relative idol, <em>except</em> the
one about to be described.</p>

<p>"This altar stands on four globes (?) cut out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
same stone: the sculpture is in <em>bas-relief</em>, and it is the
<em>only specimen of that kind of sculpture found at Copan</em>,
all the rest being in bold <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alto-relievo</i>."</p>

<p>By a reference to the map for its locality, we find
that it is situated nearly in the very centre of the vast
Temple. This, together with its being alone, unassociated
with an Idol&mdash;the sculpture being entirely
different, and "the only specimen" found there, all the
others being in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alto</i>, but this in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basso</i>&mdash;(a proof of its
greater antiquity)&mdash;the very stone seems to find a
voice to proclaim that it was the Chief Altar of Copan.
It may be "a curious subject," but certainly does
not require much "speculation" to form a conclusion.
The description of the detail of the sculpture seems to
furnish another reason for believing it to be the principal
Altar.</p>

<p>"It is six feet square, and four feet high; and the
top is divided into thirty-six tablets [or squares] of
<em>hieroglyphics</em>, which beyond doubt <em>record some</em> <small>EVENT</small>
<em>in the history</em> of the mysterious people who once inhabited
the city."</p>

<p>This we distinctly believe; and that the <em>sculpture</em>
about to be described, <small>TRANSLATES THE HIEROGLYPHICS</small>,
and those being translated, the "event in the history"
is then arrived at. Whether we have accomplished
this or not, the reader will judge as he proceeds,&mdash;for
we have looked upon this Chief Altar as the "Rosetta-stone"
of the ruins&mdash;the Key-stone in the arch of mystery.</p>

<p>"Each side of the altar represents four individuals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
On the West-side are the two principal personages,
chiefs, or warriors, with their faces opposite to each
other, and apparently engaged in argument or <em>negotiation</em>.
The other fourteen (figures) are divided into
two equal parties, and seem to be following their leaders.
Each of the two principal figures is seated <em>cross-legged</em>,
in the <em>Oriental</em> fashion, on an <em>hieroglyphic</em>,
which probably designated his name and office, or character;
and on <em>two</em> of which the <em>Serpent</em> forms
part."</p>

<p>The description reads "three," the engraving shews
only <em>two</em> Serpents; the later will be received as correct,
from the accuracy ascribed to the drawings by
Mr. Stephens, and already quoted.</p>

<p>"Between the two principal personages, is a remarkable
cartouche, containing two <em>hieroglyphics</em>, well preserved,
which reminded us <em>strongly of the Egyptian
method</em> of giving the names of the <em>kings and heroes in
whose honour monuments were erected</em>. The head-dresses
are remarkable for their curious and complicated
form. The figures have all breastplates, and
one of the two principal characters holds in his hand
an instrument, which perhaps may be considered a
sceptre,&mdash;each of the others holds an <em>object</em>, which can
be only (?) a subject for speculation and conjecture."</p>

<p>We believe them to be (judging from the engravings)
<em>spiral shells</em>; the application will be found in the
important chapter devoted to the Analogies.</p>

<p>"It [the "object"] may be a weapon of war, and if
so, it is the only thing of the kind found at Copan. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
other countries, battle scenes, warriors, and weapons
of war are among the most prominent subjects of
sculpture; and from the entire absence of them here,
there is reason to believe, <em>that the people were not
warlike, but peaceable and easily subdued</em>."</p>

<p>Are not the Sculptures, the Idols, and Altars, the
ornaments of a <em>Temple</em>?&mdash;and as a consequence,
should be devoid of the weapons of war. A false
conclusion is arrived at by Mr. Stephens, when, from
the absence of battle-axes, shields, and helms, in a
Religious Temple, it must follow as a necessity, that
those worshipping there, must be devoid of courage.
Our own Altars might be so regarded if his reasoning
was admitted, yet few persons would have the temerity
to say, because the Christian Altars are devoid of warlike
weapons, that the Anglo-Saxon race are "easily
subdued."</p>

<p>The hands that built those Temples on the Western
Continent, could also defend them. The military position
and strength of Copan, prove the builders to be
of a race far from cowards, and not easily to be conquered.
In these remarks we would not confound the
previous distinction drawn between the courage of
these Aborigines and those of the North. The Mexicans
were courageous in quick assault, but had not
the indomitable endurance and persevering fortitude of
the Northerns.</p>

<p>Enough has been quoted concerning the ruins of
Copan; yet it should be stated, that among those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
ruins was found a sculptured <em>Tortoise</em>,&mdash;this will be
referred to in the Analogies.</p>

<p>As a summary of the ruins of Copan, they are of
sculptured <em>stone</em>, with the <em>absence</em> of <em>stucco</em>; but pyramidal
structures and bases; no circular columns, but
square or four-sided obelisks, or Idols; Sculptured
Altars; flights of steps forming pyramidal slopes, but
only on three sides, excepting <em>in one instance</em>, and all
these bearing distinct testimony of having been painted
or dyed with "a red colour;" a perpendicular wall
nearly one hundred feet in height; and the sculpture
is not only rich in detail, but finely executed. At
Copan there is no vestige of wooden beams or lintels
in or about the ruins, and no appearance of a roof of
any description. The <em>arch</em> is no where found, or any
thing indicating that its principle was known to the
Copanians.</p>

<p>The absence of all <em>metal</em> is another singular feature.
The quarry from whence the stone was taken, is about
two miles distant from the Temple; and the supposition
of Mr. Stephens seems probable&mdash;viz., that from
the discovery of <em>flint</em>-stone, and of the hardest description,
the softer stone composing the Altars and Idols,
was cut with this flint in lieu of metal. Every thing
seems to denote the great antiquity of these ruins over
those of any of the other Cities; for it will be shewn
that they had a knowledge of the use of metal, and
that they had found it. At Ocosingo there is a wooden
beam, and at Palenque; and at Uxmal, all the lintels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the doors are of wood, and so hard is its character,
that a sharp knife will turn its edge upon it, as if drawn
vertically upon a bar of rough steel or iron. Therefore
from the facts contained in this summary, together
with the "event in the history" of the Chief Altar, and
yet to be given,&mdash;we have placed Copan as the most
ancient, and, as far as discovered, the first architectural
City built on the Western Continent.</p>

<p>There is one description at Copan which will be
reserved for the purpose of refuting (in the subsequent
pages) one of Mr. Stephens's conclusions, as expressed
in his Reflections upon the collective Ruins of these
Cities, "whose antiquity," in the language of the Prophet,
"is of ancient days."</p>


<h3>SECTION III.</h3>

<h4>THE RUINS OF PALENQUE.</h4>

<p>Palenque is situated in the Province of Tzendales,
Mexican America. At the distance of about eight
miles from the modern village of Palenque, the now
celebrated Ruins are located. They are called the
Ruins of <em>Palenque</em> from the name of the nearest village,
and not from any history of their own:&mdash;like the
field of Waterloo&mdash;it has given renown to an humble
village adjacent. The name, therefore, of "Palenque,"
can be of no assistance in unfolding the history
of these Ruins,&mdash;for the original name of the now desolate
Temples and Palaces, has been for centuries lost
and buried with its fate. Mr. Stephens writes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"At half-past seven we left the village. For a short
distance the road was open, but very soon we entered
a forest, which continued unbroken to the Ruins, and
probably many miles beyond. All the wreck of Empires,&mdash;nothing
ever spoke so forcibly the world's
mutations, as this immense forest shrouding what was
once a great city. Once it had been a great highway,
thronging with people who were stimulated by the
same passions that give impulse to human action
now; and they are all gone, their habitation buried,
and no traces of them left. Fording this (river Otula)
very soon we saw masses of stones, and then a <em>round
sculptured</em> stone. We spurred up a sharp ascent of
<em>fragments</em>, so steep that the mules could barely climb
it, to a terrace, so covered, like the whole road, with
trees, that it was impossible to make out the form. Continuing
on this terrace, we stopped at the foot of the
second, and through openings in the trees we saw the
front of <em>a large building</em>, richly ornamented with <em>stuccoed</em>
figures on the <em>pilasters</em>, <em>curious</em> and <em>elegant</em>;
trees growing close against them, and their branches
entering the doors; in style and effect unique, extraordinary
and mournfully beautiful. We tied our mules
to the trees, and ascended <em>a flight of stone steps</em>, forced
apart, and thrown down by trees, and entered the
Palace, ranged for a few moments along the <em>corridor</em>,
and into the <em>courtyard</em>; and after the first gaze of
eager curiosity was over, went back to the entrance,
and standing in the doorway, fired a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu de joie</i> of four
rounds each, being the last charge of our fire-arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
But for this way of giving vent to our satisfaction, we
should have made the roof of the old Palace ring with
a hurrah! We had reached the end of our long and
toilsome journey, and the first glance indemnified us
for our toil. For the time, we were in a building
erected by the <em>Aboriginal</em> inhabitants; <em>standing before</em>
the Europeans knew of the existence of this Continent;
and we prepared to take up our abode under its
roof&mdash;the sole tenants of the Palace of unknown
Kings."</p>

<p>The reader will excuse the preceding introduction&mdash;its
graphic style will find its own apology; and though
not <em>descriptive</em> of the Ruins, <em>yet the approach to them</em>
seems to form a part of this historical Romance of the
Wilderness.</p>

<p>"As at Copan, it was my business to prepare the
different objects for Mr. Catherwood to draw. Many
of the stones had to be scrubbed and cleansed; and as
it was our object to have the <em>utmost possible accuracy
in the drawings</em>, in many places scaffolds were to be
erected, on which to set up the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">camera-lucida</i>. That
the reader may know the character of the objects we
had to interest us, I proceed to give a description of
the building in which we lived, called the <em>Palace</em>. It
stands on an <em>artificial</em> elevation of an oblong form <em>forty
feet high, three hundred and ten in front and rear, and
two hundred and sixty feet on each side</em>."</p>

<p>Here, then, is distinctly stated&mdash;a pyramidal elevation
having <em>four sides</em>, and detached from any other structure.
Its measurement around the base is 1140 feet!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>This elevation was formerly faced with stone</em>,
which has been thrown down by the growth of trees,
and its form is hardly distinguishable. The building
[we say <em>Temple</em>&mdash;not Palace,] stands (on this pyramidal
elevation) with its face to the <em>East</em>, and measures
<em>two hundred feet front, by one hundred and
eighty feet deep</em>. Its height is not more than twenty-five
feet, and all around it had <em>a broad projecting
cornice of stone</em>. The front contained <em>fourteen doorways</em>,
about <em>nine feet wide</em> each, and the intervening
piers [<em>i. e.</em> square columns] are between <em>six and seven
feet wide</em>. On the left (in approaching the palace)
eight piers have fallen down, and as also the corner on
the right, and the terrace underneath is cumbered with
ruins. But six piers remain entire, and the rest of the
front is open. The building was <em>constructed of stone</em>,
with a mortar of lime and sand, and <em>the whole front
was covered with stucco and painted</em>."</p>

<p>We believe this last manner (stuccoing) to have been
ages <em>after</em> the original structure was erected, and for
the purpose of promulgating a new Religion. This important
point will be investigated in a subsequent volume.
It is only remarked here, that the reader may
not be perplexed at <em>stone</em> being covered with <em>stucco</em>,
since in building, ancient or modern, it was only usual
to cover <em>bricks</em> with plaister or stucco.</p>

<p>"The piers were ornamented with <em>spirited figures</em>
[in stucco] in bas-relief. On the top of one are <em>three</em>
hieroglyphics <em>sunk in the stucco</em>. It is enclosed by a
richly ornamented border, about ten feet high and six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
wide, of which only a part remains. The stucco is of
admirable consistency, <em>and hard as stone</em>. It was
<em>painted</em>, [stained?] and in different places about, we
discovered the remains of <em>red</em>, <em>blue</em>, <em>yellow</em>, <em>black</em>, <em>and
white</em>."</p>

<p>We have already called this edifice the <em>Temple</em>,
believing it not to have been originally a palace. This
distinction is nearly defined from the fact that <em>hieroglyphics</em>
are found upon the edifice: for hieroglyphics
(<em>i. e.</em>, sacred and symbolical writing) constitute the
Religious language of nearly all the ancient nations,&mdash;but
of Egypt especially. The language of Religion
and the Hieratic (that of the priests) were placed upon
the <em>sacred</em> edifices, and being so placed, proved them
to be Temples. Those languages were, also, painted
upon mummy-cloths and coffins, or sculptured upon the
outward granite Sarcophagii,&mdash;the Egyptians holding
the rights of Sepulture in the most sacred estimation;
for those rights were only granted upon a public investigation
of the character of the deceased, and a
general verdict in his favour. This <em>post-mortem</em>
examination of character even the king was not exempt
from, and the poorest subject of Egypt could
bring his accusation against the deceased monarch;
with the privilege of sustaining his charges by facts
and argument,&mdash;for by the laws of Egypt every
Egyptian was considered equal and noble with his
countrymen,&mdash;Character and Talent being the only
distinctions to entitle the deceased to sepulture, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the hieroglyphical inscriptions to perpetuate a name.
The King of Egypt might (and it was a custom)
build his own monument and Sarcophagus, inscribe
them with his victories and virtues; but his body
(after death) would not be placed within, unless at the
public ordeal upon his life and character the <em>People</em>
should grant permission.</p>

<p>If such a custom obtained at the present day, how
many lying tomb-stones and monumental effigies would
escape the charge of falsehood; and how many unrecorded
possessors of talent and character, would
breathe in marble for the imitation of their posterity!</p>

<p>The Enchorial language (<em>i. e.</em> the common or
spoken) was not placed (alone) on sacred edifices:
therefore its absence on a building almost demonstrates
that building to have been erected and adorned for
sacred purposes. Upon this consideration we shall
view the great edifice of Palenque,&mdash;as the Temple,
and not the Palace. And, it might naturally be asked
if this is a Palace, where is the Temple?&mdash;for in all
ancient nations the Temple of worship was always the
grandest edifice of a metropolis: the same custom is
still continued in more modern times,&mdash;Rome has its
St. Peter's, and London its St. Paul's.</p>

<p>The hieroglyphics on the Altar and Idols of Copan
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</i> last Section) in a similar manner demonstrate
those sculptures to be of a Religious character, but
that fact does not preclude the association of Historical
events,&mdash;they were so introduced and incorporated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the Egyptians and the ancients, in order to <em>deify</em> those
events;&mdash;and by thus rendering a sacristy of character
to the hero, or the glory, to give them both (in
their belief) an earthly, or rather a celestial immortality!</p>

<p>Herodotus states (ii. § 36) that the hieratic (priests)
and the demotic (common) were the two written
languages of Egypt,&mdash;these two were apart from the
hieroglyphical or <em>symbolical</em> language. Diodorus Siculus
(iii., § 3) supports his predecessor, and says that
the former (hieratic) was used <em>only by the priests</em>,&mdash;while
the latter (<em>i. e.</em> the Enchorial or demotic) was
used in common by all the Egyptians,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>, that it
was the <em>spoken</em> language of the country, and, as already
shewn, not used upon <em>sacred</em> edifices. From these
facts, derived from ancient custom, may be gathered
why the ciphers of the common language of the
Mexican Aborigines are not found upon <em>their</em> Temples;
and as a consequence, the absence of the spoken language
upon those Temples proves them (from the
ancient custom) to have been erected at a period when
that peculiar custom was practised; and therefore,
(apart from other considerations) the time of their
erection must be viewed at a remote antiquity.</p>

<p>"It (the stucco) was painted, and in different places
about we discovered the remains of <em>red</em>, <em>blue</em>, <em>yellow</em>,
black, and white."</p>

<p>In the language of the Fine Arts "black and white"
are not received as colours&mdash;they are merely accessories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Red, Blue, and Yellow, are the three; and the
only primitive earth-colours, and by their amalgamation
in certain proportions (aided by the subordinates,
black and white) all secondary colours&mdash;or <em>tints</em>
strictly speaking&mdash;are produced. The Rainbow possesses
but <em>three</em> primitive colours; but by their juxtaposition
and refractions, the purple, orange, green, and
violet are produced.</p>

<p>Titian painted a picture in which he used only the
three primitives; but taking the Rainbow for his mistress
in colouring, he so arranged the juxtapositions of
the original and "divine three," that the cloud-created
Iris might well be jealous of the triple tints of Titian!</p>

<p>No greater proof could be given of antiquity, than
the discovery that the Mexican Aborigines were
ignorant of the art of mixing colours&mdash;for the three primitives
only, and not the secondary colours&mdash;are found
upon the Temples. The "Tyrian dye" or purple, was
not extracted from the earth, but from the Sea, from a
shell-fish, since called the <em>purple murex</em>.</p>

<p>For ages it was believed that the Rainbow possessed
<em>seven</em> colours. Science has proved that it contains
but <em>three</em>. Nature has no more: and without
even alluding to other religious opinions&mdash;the Trinity
is even figured in the Rainbow: and the Divine Arch
viewed in this figurative manner, has indeed the Eye
of the Almighty upon it&mdash;<em>the Three in One</em>&mdash;it is not
only the "Covenant," but the Type of Salvation from
the Father to his children!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The reader will pardon this slight digression, and
the writer makes the following assertion for the investigation
of the curious, without any fear of a negative
being produced. The conclusion is from many years
of observation; viz., <em>That every thing in Nature of
the Animal or the Vegetable kingdom; the Rainbow
and the Elements; that all the works of Art embraced
in the comprehensive term</em>, Architecture (Edificial or
Naval): <em>in the Arch itself, and even in Mechanics;
that in all these productions of Nature or Art there
are</em> <small>ONLY THREE GRAND PARTS</small>! And many of those
parts contain within themselves <em>three</em> subdivisions.
Those subdivisions are only accessories, holding the same
relation to the whole, that the secondary colours do to
the primitives of the Rainbow. We will give a few
illustrations from Nature and Art. For instance,&mdash;the
Fruit-tree,&mdash;the three primitive parts are the roots,
trunk, and branches, these are composed of fibrum, sap,
and bark; the accessories are the leaves and fruit;
the leaf consists of the stalk, fibres, and the web; the
fruit, of the rind, the apple, and the core. The Human
form will bear the same test; viz., head, trunk, and
limbs&mdash;nay, the very principles of life, brain&mdash;lungs,
and heart; and also the great combinations in Chemistry!
The sublime science of Astronomy also
supports the conclusion. For the illustration from Art&mdash;a
Temple. The three grand divisions are the foundation,
body, and roof; the front of the edifice is in
three parts&mdash;viz., columns, entablature, and pediment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
these being subdivided, and three parts again appear:
1st, a Column,&mdash;the shaft, capital, and abacus; 2d, the
Entablature,&mdash;the architrave, frieze, and cornice; 3d,
the Pediment,&mdash;the apex, and the two corners, forming
a triangle. The triangle is, also, the facial characteristic
of a square Pyramid, and its square base contains
two triangles; but the true Pyramid contains only
three sides, each, with the base, present triangles. If
man's efforts in Art have produced by accident the</p>

<p class="center">
TRIA JUNCTA IN UNO,&mdash;
</p>

<p>we must feel that nothing in <em>Nature</em> can be accidental,
and investigation will prove that the Divine "three"
pervade all! We are not aware that the above
assertion has ever been made by any author, but we
are convinced from years of observation, that although
original and startling, it is no less the truth&mdash;for being
founded in Nature it could not be otherwise. In the
third volume this subject will be enlarged upon; for
the present we claim the discovery of this great philosophical
principle&mdash;the true active one of Nature and
of Art, with the possession of which a man has the
key to the <em>arcana</em> of both.</p>

<p>The Mexican Aborigines then had, apparently, no
knowledge of the art of mixing colours, from which
fact a strong proof is gained of their great antiquity.</p>

<p>"The piers (<em>i. e.</em> the square columns of the Temple)
which are still standing, contained other figures of the
same general character, but which unfortunately are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
more mutilated, and from the declivity of the terrace
it was difficult to set up the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">camera lucida</i> in such a
position as to draw them. The piers which are fallen
were no doubt enriched with the same ornaments.
<em>Each one</em> had a specific meaning, <em>and the whole probably
presented some allegory or history</em>, and when entire
and painted, the effect in ascending the terrace must
have been imposing and beautiful."</p>

<p>This "allegory or history" we have endeavoured
to decipher in the Analogies. The sculpture of this
Temple, like the metopes of the Parthenon, should not
be viewed in separate parts, but as a whole; for the
parts, like single letters, are useless in themselves, but
when placed together in proper and consecutive localities,
they instantly express a word, or sentences, and
thence convey to the mind the full intelligence of the
subject.</p>

<p>"The tops of the doorways are all broken. They
had evidently been square, and over one were large
niches in the wall on each side, in which the lintels
had been laid. The lintels had been all fallen, and the
stones above formed broken natural arches [angles?].
Underneath were heaps of rubbish, but there were no
remains of lintels. If they had been single slabs of
stone, some of them must have been visible and prominent,
and we made up our minds <em>that the lintels
had been of wood</em>, and perhaps we should not have
ventured the conclusion, but for the <em>wooden lintel</em>
which we had seen over the doorway at Ocosingo, and
by what we saw afterwards in Yucatan (Uxmal), we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
were confirmed beyond <em>all doubt</em> in our opinion. I do
not conceive, however, that <em>this gives any conclusive
data</em> in regard to the age of the buildings. The
wood (lintels) if such as we saw in the other
places (<em>i. e.</em> Ocosingo and Uxmal) would be very
lasting, its decay must have been extremely slow, and
<em>centuries</em> may have elapsed since it perished altogether."</p>

<p>The decaying of the lintels at Ocosingo and Palenque,
and their existence and <em>preservation</em> at Uxmal
enables a data to be formed in reference to the order
of their erection; for the <em>non-appearance</em> of any
wooden lintels at Copan authorizes the placing of that
city first in chronological order, followed by the cities
of Ocosingo and Palenque, and from the argument,
and the preservation of the wood, Uxmal was built
<em>after</em> the foregone.</p>

<p>"The building has two parallel corridors running
lengthwise <em>on all four of its sides</em>. In front these
corridors are about nine feet wide, and extend the
whole length of the building, upwards of two hundred
feet. In the long wall that divides them there is
but one door, which is opposite the principal door of
entrance, and has a corresponding one on the other
side, leading to a courtyard in the rear.</p>

<p>"<em>The floors are of cement</em>, as hard as the best seen
in the remains of Roman baths and cisterns. The
walls are about ten feet high,&mdash;<em>plastered</em>,&mdash;and on
each side of the principal entrance ornamented with
<em>medallions</em>, of which the borders only remain,&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
perhaps contained the busts of the Royal family.
The separating-wall had apertures of about a foot,
probably intended for purposes of ventilation. <em>The
builders were evidently ignorant of the principle of
the</em> <small>ARCH</small>, and the support (ceiling) was made by
stones (blocks) lapping over as they rose, as at
Ocosingo, and as among the Cyclopean remains in
Greece and Italy." * * * * "From the centre
door of this corridor a range of stone steps, thirty feet
long, leads to a rectangular courtyard, eighty feet long
by seventy broad. On each side of the steps are grim
and gigantic figures <em>carved on stone</em> in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basso relievo</i>,
nine or ten feet high, and in a position slightly inclined
backward, from the end of the steps to the floor of the
corridor. They are adorned with head-dresses and
necklaces, <em>but their attitude is that of pain and
trouble</em>. The design and anatomical proportion of the
figures are faulty, but there is a force of expression
about them which shews <em>the skill and conceptive
power of the artist</em>. On each side of the courtyard of
the Palace (Temple) are divided apartments, probably
for sleeping. (?) On the right, the piers have all
fallen down. On the left they are still standing and
ornamented with <em>stucco figures</em>. In the centre apartment,
in one of the holes, are the remains of a <em>wooden
pole</em>, about a foot long, which once stretched across,
but the rest had decayed. It was the only piece of
wood (worked) we found at Palenque, and we did not
discover this until some time after we had made up
our minds in regard to the wooden lintels over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
doors. It was much worm-eaten, and probably in a
few years not a vestige will be left. At the farther
side of the courtyard was another flight of stone steps,
corresponding with those in front, on each side of
which are carved figures, and on the flat surface between
are single <em>cartouches of hieroglyphics</em>." * * *
* * * "In the further corridor the wall was in some
places broken, and <em>had</em> <small>SEVERAL</small> <em>separate coats of
plaister and paint</em>. [Proofs of different periods] In
<em>one place we counted six layers, each of which had
the remains of colours</em>. This corridor opened to a
second courtyard, eighty feet long, and but thirty
across. The floor of the corridor was ten feet above
that of the courtyard, and on the wall underneath were
<em>square stones</em> with <em>hieroglyphics sculptured</em> upon them.
On the piers were <em>stuccoed figures</em>, but in a ruined condition.
On the other side of the courtyard were two
ranges of corridors, which terminated the building in
this direction. The first of them is divided into three
apartments, with doors opening from the extremities
upon the western corridor. All the piers are standing excepting
that on the north-west corner. All are covered
with <em>stucco ornaments</em>, and one with <em>hieroglyphics</em>. The
rest contain <em>figures</em> in <em>bas relief</em>." * * * "There
are several distinct and independent buildings. [Within
the confines of the Temple] The principal of these
is the <span class="smcap">Tower</span>, on the south side of the second court.
This Tower is conspicuous by its height and proportions:
the base is thirty feet square, and it has <em>three
stories</em>. Entering over a heap of rubbish at the base,
we <em>found within another Tower, distinct from the</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
<em>outer one</em>, and a stone staircase, so narrow that a large
man could not ascend it. The staircase terminates
against a dead stone ceiling, closing all further passage.
<em>The whole Tower was a substantial stone structure</em>,
and in its arrangements and purposes about as incomprehensible
as the sculptured tablets. East of the
Tower is another building, with two corridors, one
richly decorated with <em>pictures in stucco, and having
in the centre an elliptical tablet</em>. It is four feet long
and three wide, <em>of hard stone, set in the wall</em>, and
the <small>SCULPTURE</small> is in <em>bas relief</em>. Around it are the remains
of a rich <em>stucco border</em>. The principal figure
sits cross-legged (<em>i. e.</em> orientally) on a couch, ornamented
with two leopards' heads: the attitude is easy,
the physiognomy the same as that of the other personages,
and the <em>expression calm and benevolent</em>. The
figure wears around its neck a necklace of pearls
[beads of gold?] to which is suspended a small medallion
containing a face, perhaps for an image of the
Sun."</p>

<p>From the positive radii around the medallion
(as presented by the artist) there can be no hesitation
in distinctly stating that it was intended for
an "image of the Sun." This is essential in identifying
the analogy of Religious worship: it also gives
further authority for the belief that this edifice was a
Temple, and not a Palace. The <em>Tower</em> of Palenque
also aids this belief, for from its locality it would seem
to have been used as a modern oriental minaret, from
which the priests summoned the people to prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like every subject of sculpture we had seen in
this country, the personage had earrings, bracelets on
the wrists, and a girdle round the loins. The head-dress
differs from most of the others at Palenque in
that it wants the plume of feathers. Near the head
are <em>three hieroglyphics</em>. The other figure, which
seems that of a woman is sitting cross-legged [kneeling?]
on the ground, richly dressed, and apparently in
the act of <em>making an offering</em>. In this supposed offering
is seen a plume of feathers, in which the head-dress
of the principal personage is deficient. Over the
head of the sitting personage are <em>four hieroglyphics</em>.
<em>This is the only piece of Sculptured Stone about the
the Palace</em> (Temple) except those in the courtyard.
Under it formerly stood a table [altar?] of which the
impression against the wall is still visible."</p>

<p>It will be observed that the above <em>Sculpture is the
only one in Stone</em> in the interior of the Temple; and
from the image of the Sun suspended from the neck
of the principal figure, whose countenance is "calm
and benevolent," and the richly-attired kneeling figure
making an offering, the Sculpture seems to represent
the Apollo of the Aborigines receiving a tributary
gift. The "Table" underneath and in front, is in the
very position of an Altar-table, upon which may have
been placed the votive offerings of the living, in imitation
of the Sculpture above the Altar. In a similar
manner the more modern altar of the Christians is
placed, for it is stationed beneath the artistical object
of worship or the tables of the Decalogue. A painting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
over a Christian altar, of the Magii adoring the Infant
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, and thereby calling for similar worship from
the living, will completely illustrate the sculptured
altar-piece of Palenque. We think that this will be
admitted, and being so it establishes that this great
edifice was one of the chief Temples of the Aborigines,
erected by them for the worship of their God
of light and heat&mdash;viz., the Sun.</p>

<p>This may then have been the Mecca-shrine of the
Kingdom, to which all the nation made their annual
pilgrimage; and especially do we believe this to have
been the case, from the fact of the <em>stucco</em> being placed
upon the <em>stone</em>, and the former illustrating a later Religion
than that proved by the stone-sculpture; and
the Religion being partially changed (as will be shewn
hereafter), still it was the chief Temple for the assemblage
of the people, and from which, perhaps, from
the Tower of the Temple, was promulgated not only
any change in the form of Religious worship, but also
in the Laws of the country. Every thing indicates that
this edifice was the Aboriginal Temple of the Sun: if
it was the Palace, again would we ask, where is the
Temple? for in all ancient nations, the edifice in which
was performed the Religion of the country, was of
more importance than any earthly residence. Jerusalem,
Athens, and Rome, possessed the Temple, the
Parthenon, the Capitol, and the Pantheon; Tyrus,
Carthage, and Palmyra, their gorgeous Temple to
Apollo (<em>i. e.</em> the Sun); Italy, England, and France,
justly boast of their Churches sacred to St. Peter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
St. Paul, and the Mother of the Saviour!&mdash;and the
great Mahommedan family point with religious joy to the
Shrine at Mecca; and why then should the Aborigines
of the Western Hemisphere be an exception?</p>

<p>The jewelled Temples of the Sun (<em>i. e.</em> of Apollo),
that in Mexico and Peru tempted the blood-stained
feet of Cortez and Pizarro, were but the types of the
original at Palenque; for the latter was in ruins when
the Spanish pirates landed, and none of their historians
even allude to the desolation of past ages, so engrossed
were they with that of their own!</p>

<p>Another description of a piece of Sculpture (in
stucco) upon a building near the Temple of Palenque,
will be reserved for illustrating a powerful similitude
to a Tyrian branch of worship. This will receive
a full investigation in the chapter devoted to the
national Analogies.</p>

<p>On the map of the Ruins of Palenque, and in the
descriptions (as furnished in Mr. Stephens's work), the
Temple, and <em>five other</em> edifices, all rise from a pyramidal
base, having <em>four sides</em>; this fact will again be
brought forward in refutation of one of his architectural
conclusions.</p>


<h3>SECTION IV.</h3>

<h4>THE RUINS OF UXMAL.</h4>

<p>These monuments of antiquity are situated in Yucatan,
the great Peninsula of Mexican America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Emerging suddenly from the woods, to my astonishment,
we came at once upon a large open field
strewed with mounds of ruins, and vast buildings on
terraces, and <em>pyramidal structures</em>, grand, and in good
preservation, richly ornamented, without a bush to obstruct
the view; and in picturesque effect, almost equal
to the Ruins of Thebes. [Egypt] Such was my report
I made to Mr. Catherwood on my return, who,
lying in his hammock unwell, and out of spirits, told
me I was romancing; but early the next morning we
were on the ground, and his comment was, that the
<em>reality exceeded the description</em>!"</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the above distinguished
artist (Catherwood) had visited and copied
the Ruins of Thebes and Egypt generally, and consequently
his testimony is of more than common authority.</p>

<p>"The place of which I am now speaking (Uxmal)
was, beyond all doubt, once a large, populous, and
highly <em>civilized city, and the reader can nowhere find
one word of it on any page of history</em>. Who built
it?&mdash;why it was located on that spot, away from
water, or any of those natural advantages which have
determined the sites of cities whose histories are known,
what led to its abandonment, no man can tell. The
only name by which it is known, is that of the Hacienda
[<em>i. e.</em> farm-plantation] on which it stands. In the
oldest deed, belonging to the Peon family [<em>i. e.</em> the
owners], which goes back a hundred and forty years,
the buildings are referred to in the boundaries of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
estate as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Las Casas de Piedra</i> [<em>i. e.</em> the stone-houses].
This is the only ancient document or record in existence,
in which the place is mentioned at all. The
Ruins were all exhumed: within the last year the trees
had been cut down and burned, and the whole field of
Ruins was in view." * * * * "In attempting a
description of the Ruins, so vast a work rises up before
me, that I am at a loss where to begin." * * * *
"Drawn off by mounds of ruins and piles of gigantic
buildings, the eye returns, and again fastens upon a
lofty structure. It was the first building I entered.
<em>From its front doorway I counted sixteen elevations</em>
[buildings], <em>with broken walls and mounds of stones,
and vast magnificent edifices</em>, which at that distance
seemed untouched by time and defying ruin. I stood
in the doorway when the Sun went down, throwing
from the buildings a prodigious breadth of shadow,
darkening the terraces on which they stood, and presenting
a scene strange enough for a work of enchantment.
This building [<em>i. e.</em> in which he viewed the
scene] is sixty-eight feet long. The elevation on
which it stands, is built up solid from the plain, entirely
artificial. <em>Its form is not pyramidal</em>, but <em>oblong</em>,
and rounding, being two hundred and forty feet long
<em>at the base</em>, and one hundred and twenty feet broad,
and it is protected all around, <em>to the very top, by a wall
of square stones</em>."</p>

<p>The terms of the last sentence are in direct opposition
to the description,&mdash;for the elevation is distinctly
<em>pyramidal</em>. It does not require a square base only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
rising from their corners to a central apex, to be essentially
pyramidal,&mdash;for a <em>cone</em> is pyramidal, or an
"oblong" rising and diminishing from a broad base;
all walls on <em>an inclined plane</em>&mdash;no matter at what degree
of elevation or declivity, possess the chief essential
of a pyramid.</p>

<p>The cone, oblong, and square,&mdash;even a triple-sided
or octagonal pyramid, would be, one and all, correct
phrases in the language of Architecture, to express the
character of the pyramid; and are so used in contradistinction
to walls (one or more) of a perpendicular
description,&mdash;and the instant such walls lose the facial
of the plumb-line, they become <em>pyramidal</em>, from the
principle of the wall rising from its base, and falling
to a centre, which, we repeat, is the chief essential of
the pyramid. The number of sides, or none at all
(<em>i. e.</em> a cone), has no part in the pyramidal <em>principle</em>;
as the key-stone is to the Arch, so the apex is to the
Pyramid; but if the latter <em>is only half reared</em>, yet approaching
by the inclined walls <em>towards an apex</em>, it is
as much a pyramidal structure as if the sides had
reached the apex itself. It is to be regretted that Mr.
Stephens should have been ignorant of the Fine Arts
and their rules&mdash;(we make this remark on his own honest
confession<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>)&mdash;because by the confusion of terms he
not only often contradicts himself, but misleads the
general reader in forming conclusions from his graphic
descriptions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>It will, however, be our duty not to pass any such
contradiction, but by the rules of art endeavour to
translate the language of the Ruins. Mr. Stephens
has, however, a <em>motive</em> in destroying all resemblance
between these edifices and those of Egypt, <em>or their
neighbours</em>. In the next chapter that motive will be
unfolded in his own words.</p>

<p>"On the East side of the structure is a <em>broad range
of stone steps</em>, between eight and nine inches high, and
so steep, that the greatest care is required in ascending
and descending: of these we counted <em>one hundred and
one in their places</em>. <em>Nine were wanting at the top</em>,
and perhaps <em>twenty</em> were covered with rubbish at the
bottom. At the <em>summit</em> of the steps is a <em>stone platform</em>
four feet and a half wide, running along the rear
of the building. There is no door in the centre, but
at each end a door opens into an apartment eighteen
feet long and nine wide, and between the two is a third
apartment of the same width, and thirty-four feet long.
<em>The whole building is of stone; inside the walls are
of polished smoothness</em>; outside, up to the height of
the door, the stones are plain and square; above this
line there <em>is a rich cornice or moulding</em>, and from this
to the top of the building, <em>all the sides are covered
with rich and elaborate sculptured ornaments, forming
a sort of arabesque</em>. The style and character of these
ornaments were entirely different from those of any we
had seen before, either in that country or any other; they
bore no resemblance whatever to those of Copan or Palenque,
and were quite as unique and peculiar. The designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
were strange and incomprehensible, very elaborate,
sometimes grotesque, but often simple, tasteful,
and beautiful. Among the intelligible subjects, are
squares and diamonds (<em>i. e.</em> forms), with busts of
human beings, heads of leopards, and compositions of
leaves and flowers, and the ornaments known every
where as <em>grecques</em>. The ornaments which succeed
each other are all different; the whole form an extraordinary
mass of richness and complexity, and the
effect is both grand and curious; and the construction
of these ornaments is not less peculiar and striking
than the general effect. There were no tablets or
single stones, each representing separately, or by itself,
an entire subject; but every ornament or combination
is made up of separate stones, on each of which <em>part</em>
of the subject was carved [sculptured], <em>and was then
set in its place in the wall</em>. (?) Each stone by itself
was an unmeaning fractional part; but placed by the
side of others helped to make a whole, which, without
it would be incomplete. Perhaps it may, with propriety,
be called a species of sculptured <em>mosaic</em>."</p>

<p>This last sentence cannot be entertained,&mdash;for <em>mosaic</em>
is an arrangement of <small>COLOURED</small> stones, to represent
a <em>painted floor</em>, wall, or ceiling,&mdash;their shape is
not material, but they must be possessed of different
colours. Now this does not appear upon the walls of
Uxmal [<em>i. e.</em> of the edifice now in review], and the
absence of <em>coloured</em> stones gives the negative to their
being even "a species of mosaic." Nor were the stones
<em>first</em> sculptured, "and then set in their places in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
wall;" that is entirely a modern custom; but by applying
the history of ancient sculpture to the preceding
description, the means whereby the accuracy of facial
sculpture of the wall was obtained, is at once defined
and established. The Greeks placed the stones of
their friezes and pediments upon their Temples in their
<em>rough state</em>,&mdash;<em>they were sculptured afterwards</em>, and
consequently the greatest accuracy in the connecting
lines from one stone to another was obtained, and could
be by that manner only. The fluting of a column (of
one or more blocks of marble) was always sculptured
<em>after</em> it had been erected in its rough state. This was
the only practice in that branch of art, and without
doubt it was (it must have been) so practised upon the
beautiful and unique walls of Uxmal.</p>

<p>In perusing the foregone descriptions, the reader may
almost ask himself if his perceptive powers are not betraying
him?&mdash;whether he is reading of an Athenian
display of Sculpture, or really of an ancient edifice on
the Western Continent! Well might it have appeared
to the bewildered traveller as "a work of
enchantment." He then proceeds to describe another
building of the same character and sculpture: an
edifice supposed to have "some reference to the Vestals,
who in Mexico were employed to keep burning the
sacred fire." It is thus sketched:</p>

<p>"It is situated on an artificial elevation about
fifteen feet high. Its form is quadrangular, and one
side, according to my measurement, is ninety-five
<em>paces</em> in length. It was not possible to pace all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
around it, from the masses of fallen stones which encumbered
it in some places, but it may be safely
stated at <em>two hundred-and-fifty feet square</em> [<em>i. e. one
thousand feet</em> in the entire measurement!]. It is built
entirely of <em>cut stone</em> [like the other buildings] and
the whole exterior is filled with the same rich, elaborate,
and incomprehensible sculptured ornaments. The
principal entrance is by a large doorway into a beautiful
<em>patio</em> or courtyard, grass-grown but clear of trees,
and the whole of the <em>inner façade is ornamented more
richly and elaborately than the outside</em>, and in a more
perfect state of preservation."</p>

<p>This may be accounted for from the apparent fact,
that the interior sculpture was executed <em>after</em> that on
the outward walls; for it appears to be far more beautiful
and elaborate, and thence more time would be
required for its completion, and as a consequence, it
could only be finished at a later date; added to this a
greater protection from the weather is given to the
<em>inside</em> of quadrangular walls than on the outside, and
that without any reference to roofs or coverings:
for a strong wind striking, for instance, an easterly
wall on the outside, the force of the wind is destroyed,
and consequently reaches the opposite wall <em>in the area</em>
with a greatly diminished power. The same argument
would apply to the wind from any quarter, blowing
upon unroofed quadrangular structures, and this these
builders seem to have completely understood by
making the Sculpture more refined and delicate upon
the inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"On one side the combination [of the Sculpture]
was in the form of diamonds, simple, chaste, and tasteful:
and at the head of the courtyard <em>two gigantic
serpents</em> (with their heads broken and fallen) were
winding from opposite directions along the whole
façade"&mdash;[<em>i. e.</em> one thousand feet].</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Chief Altar at
Copan has sculptured on it <em>two serpents</em>: in the Analogies
we shall endeavour to read these wily hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>"In front and on a line with the door of the preceding
edifice, is another building on a lower foundation
of the same general character, called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Casa de Tortugas</i>,
from the sculptured <em>turtles</em> over the doorway."</p>

<p>That the reader may not be misled, these "turtles"
are not as defined in Scripture (<em>i. e.</em> young doves), but
the <em>tortoise</em>, the well-known shellfish; and in the
splendid illustrations of these Ruins in Waldeck's work
(folio, 1838) the <em>tortoise</em> is distinctly given, and without
doubt is so meant by Mr. Stephens. There are
<em>four of them</em> in a group, their heads approaching to a
centre, <em>each tortoise</em> is in a square, and in the two
external angles of each square is an <em>Egg</em>. The <em>tortoise</em>
and <em>the egg</em>, are both National emblems, and the
Nation claiming them will be proved in the Analogies.</p>

<p>"In the front was a broad avenue with a line of
ruins on each side, leading beyond the wall to a great
mound of ruins: and beyond this a lofty building in
the rear. Between the two was a large <em>patio</em>, or
courtyard, with corridors on each side, and the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the courtyard sounded hollow. In one place, the
surface was broken, and I descended into <em>a large excavation,
cemented</em>, which probably had been intended
as a granary. [Rather as a <em>water</em> reservoir] At the
back of the courtyard, on a high, broken terrace,
which it was difficult to climb, was another edifice
more ruined than the others, but which from the style
of its remains, and its commanding position, overlooking
every other building [except the first described]
and apparently having been connected with the distant
mass of ruins in front, must have been one of the most
important in the City, perhaps the principal Temple.
The whole presented a scene of barbaric (?) magnificence,
utterly confounding all previous notions in regard
to the Aboriginal inhabitants of this Country; and
calling up emotions which had not been wakened to
the same extent by any thing we had yet seen."</p>

<p>"There was one strange circumstance connected
with these ruins&mdash;viz., no water had ever been discovered,
and there was not a single stream, fountain, or
well, nearer than the Hacienda, a mile and a half distant.
It is supposed that the face of the Country had
not changed; and that somewhere under ground must
exist great wells, cisterns or reservoirs [perhaps acquaducts]
which supplied the former inhabitants of the
City with water." * * * * * "While I was making
the circuit of these ruins, Mr. Catherwood proceeded to
the <em>Casa del Gobernador</em>; it indicates the principal
building of the old City, or <em>royal</em> house. (?) It <em>is the
grandest in position</em>, the <em>most stately in Architecture</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<em>and proportions, and the most perfect in preservation</em>
of all the structures remaining at Uxmal."</p>

<p>The same argument brought forward in the last Section,
to prove that the chief edifice of Palenque was the
<em>Temple</em>, and not the Palace, will apply to this supposed
"royal house." As to the phrase "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Casa del
Gobernador</i>"&mdash;or Governor's house,&mdash;it is the name by
which it is called in the neighbourhood, and can have
no bearing upon the true character of the edifice,&mdash;but
the very superior preservation of the building would
point it to be one held Sacred from any rude assault
by the people; while its Architecture, importance of
its position, and magnitude, at once justify the name of
Temple being given to this edifice, and as such we shall
view it. Mr. Stephens appears to be so strict a Spartan
Republican, that every large, or magnificent building
in the Ruined Cities, he considers to be a <em>Palace</em>,&mdash;he
seems to have thought less of mind, than of matter.</p>

<p>"This edifice [Temple] stands on three ranges of
terraces. The first terrace is <em>six hundred and forty feet
long, and five feet</em> high. It is walled with <em>cut stone</em>,
and on the top is a <em>platform twenty feet broad</em>, from
which rises another terrace <em>fifteen feet</em> high. At the
corners this terrace is supported by cut stones, having
the faces rounded so as to give a better finish than with
sharp angles. The great platform is flat. At the
south-east corner of this platform is a row of <span class="antiqua">ROUND</span>
<em>pillars eighteen inches in diameter</em>, and three or four
feet high, [<em>i. e.</em> broken pillars] extending about one
hundred feet along the platform; and these were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
<em>nearest approach to pillars</em> or <em>columns</em> (circular)
that we saw in all our exploration of ruins of that
country."</p>

<p>What "nearer approach" was necessary to prove the
existence of circular columns, than his own description?
Of this hereafter,&mdash;again he writes:</p>

<p>"In the middle of the terrace, along an avenue
leading to a range of steps, was a <em>broken round pillar</em>,
inclined and falling, and with trees growing around it.
In the centre of the platform, at a distance of two hundred
and five feet from the border in front, is a range of
stone steps, more than a hundred feet broad, and
thirty-five in number, ascending to a third terrace,
fifteen feet above the last, and thirty-five feet from
the ground; which being on a naked plain, formed a
most commanding position. The erection of these
terraces alone was an immense work. <em>On the third
terrace</em>, with its principal doorway facing the range of
steps, stands the noble structure. [Temple] The
façade measures <em>three hundred and twenty feet</em>. Away
from the regions of dreadful rains, and the rank growth
which smothers the Ruins of Palenque,&mdash;it stands
with all its walls erect, and almost as perfect as when
deserted by the inhabitants. The <em>whole building is of
stone</em>, plain up to the moulding that runs along the tops
of the doorway, and above filled with the same rich,
strange, and elaborate Sculpture; among which is particularly
conspicuous, the ornament before referred to,
as <em>la grecque</em>."</p>

<p>By a reference to the illustrated folio of Waldeck, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
is found that this ornament is chiefly the meander, or
the Grecian square border, used in the embroidery of
the mantles and robes of Attica.</p>

<p>"There is no rudeness or barbarity in the design or
proportions; on the contrary, the whole wears an air
of Architectural symmetry and grandeur; and as the
stranger ascends the steps, and casts a bewildered eye
along its open and desolate doors, it is hard to believe,
that he sees before him the work of a race in whose
epitaph, as written by historians,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> they are called ignorant
of Art, and said to have perished in the rudeness
of savage life."</p>

<p>In justice to those historians, it should be stated, that
they did not know of these architectural wonders;
for if they did, no excuse can be rendered in extenuation
of such an "epitaph"&mdash;thence has arisen the
necessity of a New History of Ancient America; to,
at least, the landing of Columbus; and even that will
now wear another aspect. Mr. Stephens, in the last
sentence quoted, justly reasons upon, and correctly censures
the false conclusions of those historians;&mdash;yet a
few pages before, he, himself, calls the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>
of the Uxmal Ruins, with all the beautiful Sculpture,
and Classical ornaments, "a scene of <em>barbaric</em> magnificence!"
He seems afraid to combat with even the
assertions of those Historians, whose "epitaph" upon
an entire people, was written in ignorance of their
works of Art. He says, "<em>it is hard to believe</em>" that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
they "perished in the rudeness of savage life,"&mdash;why,
with such a gorgeous "scene" as that of Uxmal before
him, <em>it was an impossibility</em> that they could so have
perished, either in the mind, or in history. The Ruins
and Temple of Uxmal, he says, present "a scene of
<em>barbaric</em> magnificence!" <em>if they do</em>,&mdash;either to himself
or his readers, then were Athens and the Acropolis
barbaric, and Pericles and Phidias barbarians!</p>

<p>"But there was one thing which seemed in strange
want of conformity with all the rest. I have mentioned
that at Ocosingo [Ruins] we saw a <em>wooden beam</em>, and
at Pelanque, the remains of a wooden pole; at this
place [Uxmal] <em>all the lintels had been of wood, and
throughout the ruins, most of them were still in their
places over the doors</em>. The lintels were heavy beams,
eight or nine feet long, eighteen or twenty inches wide,
and twelve or fourteen thick; the wood like that of
Ocosingo, was very hard, and rang under the blow of
the machete."</p>

<p>From a further description, it appears that this peculiar
wood was brought from a distance of three hundred
miles. Waldeck says, that it is more durable
than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lignum vitæ</i>, and is called by the natives <em>jovillo</em>.
The strength of this wood is thus shewn by Mr. Stephens:</p>

<p>"The position of these lintels was most trying, as
they were obliged to support a solid mass of stone
wall, <em>fourteen or sixteen feet high, and three or four
feet in thickness</em>."</p>

<p>From a calculation of the measurements around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
base of the principal terrace, or pyramidal elevation,
the entire distance is <em>two thousand five hundred and
sixty feet</em>. The Temple, which stands upon a third
terrace, is fronting to the East,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> to the rising Sun,&mdash;the
chief object of Worship.</p>

<p>"In the centre [of the Temple], and opposite the
range of steps leading to the terrace, are three principal
doorways. The middle one is eight feet six
inches wide, and eight feet ten inches high; the others
are of the same height, but two feet less in width. The
centre door opens into an apartment sixty feet long,
and twenty-seven feet deep [wide], which is divided
into two corridors by a wall three and a half feet
thick, with a door of communication between, of the
same size with the door of entrance. The <em>plan is the
same</em> as that of the Corridor in front of the Palace (?)
of Palenque, except that here the Corridor does not
run the whole length of the building, and the back
Corridor has no door of egress. The ceiling forms
a <em>triangular Arch</em>, without the Key-stone, as at Palenque."</p>

<p>The term "triangular <em>Arch</em>" cannot be admitted by
the language of Architecture; he might as well have
written <em>triangular semicircle</em>, terms distinctly opposed
to each other. It is essential to notice this inaccuracy
here, otherwise the reader may be under the erroneous
impression, that the <em>Arch</em> does exist in the ancient
Ruins in America,&mdash;this is not the fact; but <em>the entire
absence of the Arch, or its principle</em>, enables us to form
an Architectural conclusion in reference to their identity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and the fact, <em>that the Arch does not exist</em> in any
of the Ruins of Ancient America, cannot be too forcibly
impressed upon the reader's mind; for it demonstrates
that these buildings were erected <em>before the Arch was
known</em>, and as a consequence, is a direct proof of their
great antiquity. Mr. Stephens has already written in
reference to Palenque, and previously quoted, "The
builders were evidently ignorant of the principles of
the Arch."</p>

<p>"The ceiling, &amp;c.: but, instead of the rough stones
overlapping or being covered with stucco, (as at Palenque)
the layers of stones are bevilled as they rise,
<em>and present an even and a polished</em> surface. Throughout,
the laying and the polishing of the stones are as
perfect as under the rules of the best modern masonry.
In this apartment we determined to take up our abode,
and <em>under a roof, tight</em> as when sheltering the heads of
its former occupants." * * * * * "We were not buried
in the forest as at Palenque. From every part of
the terrace we looked over a field of ruins." * * * *
"From the centre apartment, the divisions on each
wing corresponded exactly in size and finish; and the
same uniformity was preserved in the ornaments.
Throughout, the roof was tight, and the apartments
were dry. In one apartment, the walls were
<em>coated with a very fine plaister of Paris</em>, (?) equal
to the best seen on walls in this country. (United
States) The rest were all of <em>smooth polished stone</em>.
There were no paintings, stucco ornaments, Sculptured
tablets, or other decoration whatever."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Stephens then relates the finding in a ruined
Chamber, of "<em>A beam of wood</em>, (<em>i. e.</em> the jovillo)
about ten feet long, and very heavy, which had fallen
from its place over the doorway. On the face was a
line of characters <em>carved</em> or stamped (?) almost obliterated,
but which we made out to be <em>hieroglyphics</em>;
and so far as we could understand them <em>similar to
those at Copan and Palenque</em>. I cannot help deploring
the misfortune of not being assured of the safety of this
beam. <em>By what feeble light the pages of American
History are written</em>! There are at Uxmal no Idols as
at Copan,&mdash;not a single stuccoed figure, or carved
tablet, as at Palenque. Except this beam of <em>hieroglyphics</em>,
though searching earnestly, we did not discover
any one absolute point of resemblance."</p>

<p>The <em>hieroglyphics</em> of all the ruins bind them together
as one People; the difference in the finish of the
edifices, and their varied states of preservation, at
once point to different ages in which they were
erected. A principal ornament at equi-distances in
the outward cornice is important, and is thus described
by Stephens, and strictly agrees with the folio work
by Waldeck.</p>

<p>"It is the face of a death's-head, <em>with wings expanded</em>,
and rows of teeth projecting, in effect somewhat
like the figure of <em>a death's-head on tombstones
with us</em>. It is two feet across the wings, and has a
stone staple about two feet long, by which it was fastened
to the wall."</p>

<p>In Waldeck's beautiful illustrations of these ruins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
some feet below this winged death's-head, are the
cross-bones distinct, and below these, is a human figure
(male) in full maturity, and naked, except the shoulders
and head, standing with his arms <em>crossed</em> "in
sorrow's knot." These Sculptures appear upon, what
Waldeck calls the Pyramid of Kingsborough,&mdash;so
named, as before stated, in compliment to Lord Kingsborough,
for his costly work upon the Paintings of
Mexico. [7 vols. folio.] Well may Stephens say, there
are no "Idols" here as at Copan. <em>Heathen</em> language
is not seen in the Sculpture of Uxmal; the <em>Christian</em>
language alone can translate the above emblems of the
Resurrection! The translation of the above Sculpture
seems as easy, as if a <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> had already read
the handwriting on the wall! as thus&mdash;The human
figure, in full life and maturity, together with the sex,
presents mortality; over the figure the <em>cross-bones</em> are
placed, portraying the figure's earthly death; while
the skull supported by expanding wings, (and this
Sculpture being placed above those of life and death,)
presents the immortal Soul ascending on the wings of
Time, above all earthly life, or the corruption of the
grave! "On tombstones with us" a better design
could not have been formed by Art to enforce the belief
in the Resurrection. The beauty of this subject
has led us into digression, for it belongs to the third
volume. Campbell will apologize for us&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Coming events cast their shadow before."<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Stephens continues:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"The reader will be able to form some idea of the
time, skill, and labour, required for making them [the
edifices]; and more than this, to conceive the immense
time, skill, and labour required for carving [sculpturing]
such a surface of stone; and the wealth, power, and
cultivation of the people who could command such
skill and labour for the mere decoration of the edifices.
Probably all these ornaments have a symbolical meaning;
[they certainly have] each stone is part of an
<em>allegory</em> or <em>fable</em> (?) hidden from us, inscrutable under
the light of the feeble torch we may burn before it,
but which, <em>if ever revealed, will shew that the History
of the World yet remains to be written</em>."</p>

<p>With all humility we have attempted to "reveal"
one portion of the Sculpture, (others will follow)&mdash;but
the emblems of Christianity and the Resurrection, can
form no part "of an allegory or fable;" and truly has
the History of the World yet to be written, when historians
in ignorance of the Ruins, have traced the Aborigines,
who built the gorgeous edifices of Palenque and
Uxmal, to have lived and perished in a savage life!
From the character of the Sculpture, and its devices,
Uxmal is placed by us as the last built of all the Ancient
Cities as yet discovered on the Western Continent.</p>

<p>Having made sufficient extracts from Mr. Stephens's
work on "Central America," in illustration of Copan,
Palenque, and Uxmal, the principal Cities of Ruins;
the Traveller's reflections upon his explorations will
now be given, and his conclusions met and refuted. We
desire, before we commence the following Chapter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
refutation, to impress the reader's mind with the importance
of a complete removal of the conclusions,
arrived at by Mr. Stephens in regard to these Ruins;&mdash;for
if he is right, we are stopped at the very threshold
of our History. We confess this with all honesty, and
desire thereby to arouse the minute attention of the
reader to the several points of refutation,&mdash;to analyze
them critically, and to yield nothing,&mdash;but from conviction
of foregone errors and false conclusions.</p>

<p>In conformity with the rule of argument with which
this volume was commenced, we presume that the preceding
Chapter completely establishes in the mind of
the reader, that Ancient Cities and Ruins have been
discovered in Mexican America; in this belief, the
History will be continued, and the Builders and Architecture
identified.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">A REVIEW OF THE REFLECTIONS OF MR. STEPHENS UPON
THE RUINS OF MEXICAN AMERICA&mdash;HIS CONCLUSIONS
FOUNDED UPON FALSE PREMISES&mdash;HIS ERRORS DETECTED
BY HIS OWN CONTRADICTIONS&mdash;RESTORATION OF THE
TEMPLE OF UXMAL&mdash;HIS CHIEF MOTIVE APPARENT&mdash;HIS
ARGUMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS REFUTED&mdash;AND THE ARCHITECTURE
OF THE RUINS IDENTIFIED AND ESTABLISHED&mdash;REMARKS
UPON ROBERTSON'S HISTORY OF
AMERICA.</p></blockquote>


<p>The interesting Traveller in his last chapter but
one of his Second Volume on "Central America,"
says&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have finished the explorations of ruins,&mdash;and
here I would be willing to part, and to leave the reader
to wander alone, and at will through the labyrinth of
mystery which hangs over these ruined cities; but it
would be craven to do so without turning for a moment
to the important question. <em>Who were the people
that built these cities?</em> I shall narrow down this
question to a ground even yet sufficiently broad,&mdash;viz.,
a <em>comparison of these remains with those of the Architecture
and Sculpture of other ages and people</em>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>It is upon this "ground" of his own choosing that
we propose to attack his man&oelig;uvring,&mdash;it is the only
field of argument where the necessary truth can be
elicited; and he cannot object if his apparently fortified
positions should be attacked, and if not sufficiently
defended, he will not wonder that they should be demolished
or overthrown; and if we cannot succeed in
so doing, we are willing to admit, that his "Conclusions"
will be to this work what the heir-apparent of
the Scottish throne was to Macbeth; and the same
words (except one) will speak our frank confession&mdash;viz.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"The Prince of Travellers! That is a step</div>
<div class="line">On which I must fall down, <em>or else o'er-leap</em>,</div>
<div class="line">For in my way it lies."</div>
</div></div>

<p>He writes:</p>

<p>"I set out with the proposition that they are not Cyclopean,
and do not resemble the works of Greek or
Roman."</p>

<p>We admit the negative to the first and last proposition,
but not to the second,&mdash;for the sculpture at Uxmal
is not only as fine, but distinctly of a Grecian
character: the meander, or square running border, is
essentially Grecian; and even his own description,&mdash;viz.,
"Composition of leaves and flowers, and the ornaments
known everywhere as <em>grecques</em>." Here is
the distinct phrase of his own selection, brought as
evidence against his conclusion on the second proposition.</p>

<p>The engravings in Waldeck's folio work of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Ruins, substantiate every description by Stephens, as
being correct: the whole façades have, to the eye, an
appearance in regard to the character of the ornaments,
which compels the looker-on to exclaim, "<em>Grecian
knowledge has been there!</em>"</p>

<p>"There is nothing in Europe like them. [the Ruins]
We must then look to Asia or Africa. It has been
supposed that at different periods of time, <em>vessels from
Japan and China have been thrown</em> <span class="smcap">Upon the Western</span>
<em>coast of America</em>. [<em>i. e.</em> on the Pacific Ocean] The
civilization, cultivation, and science of those countries
are known to date back from a very early antiquity."</p>

<p>The latter sentence does not admit of question; but
that the Chinese or Japanese possessed navigation, with
"its means and appliances," at a period to meet these
Ruins, or to cover "a very early antiquity," cannot for
a moment be sustained by history or even tradition.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephens does not claim China and Japan as the
nations building these Cities, but rejects them upon the
ground of Architectural comparison. We instantly
join in this decision, and to it add the impossibility
from the want of navigable means; but, says the Traveller,
the supposition is, that they (the vessels) were
"<em>thrown upon the Western</em> coast of America," and thereby
expressing that the arrival of those vessels was <em>accidental</em>.
We will prove the impossibility of this,&mdash;for
any vessel in the North <em>Pacific</em> Ocean, having left
China or Japan, and becoming unmanageable from loss
of rudder, the prevailing <em>East-wind</em> would not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<em>prevent</em> the vessel from reaching the <em>Western</em> coast
of America, <em>but actually would drive the ship</em> <small>BACK</small> <em>to
China or Japan</em>! This last sentence is not given to
refute Mr. Stephens, but those writers who may have
(as he states) even "supposed" the possibility of vessels
being accidentally "thrown upon the <em>Western</em>
coast of America." Nature would prevent it. This
celebrated "East-wind" we shall have occasion to
analyze and explain, in the investigation of the first
voyage around the Continent of Africa by the Tyrians.
In the <em>Pacific</em> Ocean the East wind would prevent
<i>accidental</i> arrival on the shores of the Western Continent;
but in the <em>Atlantic</em> Ocean the same wind would
aid and expedite such an arrival, which, however,
would be upon the <em>Eastern</em>, and not the <em>Western</em>
coast of America!</p>

<p>"The monuments of India have been made familiar
to us. The remains of Hindu architecture exhibit immense
excavations in the rock, either entirely artificial,
or made by enlarging natural caverns, supported in
front by large columns cut out of the rock, with a dark
gloomy interior. Among all these American Ruins
there is not a single excavation. The surface of the
country abounding in mountain sides, seems to invite
it; but, instead of being under ground, the striking
feature of these Ruins is, that the buildings <em>stand on
lofty artificial elevations</em>; and it can hardly be supposed
that a people emigrating to a new country, with
that strong natural impulse to perpetuate, and retain
under their eyes <em>memorials of home</em>, would have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
so directly counter to <em>National and Religious associations</em>."</p>

<p>The reasoning in the latter part of the foregone
extract, is founded upon Nature, and therefore just,&mdash;it
cannot be shaken,&mdash;it cannot be even assaulted;&mdash;we
claim this admission, however, for our own position
also, when in the next chapter we bring forward the
"memorials of home," and the "national and religious
associations,"&mdash;for upon the Analogies, the corner-stone
of this Epoch is founded.</p>

<p>"In Sculpture, too, the Hindus differ entirely. Their
subjects are far more hideous, being, in general, representations
of human beings, distorted, deformed,
and unnatural,&mdash;very often many-headed, or with three
or four arms and legs thrown out from the same
body."</p>

<p>The Hindu is rejected, and justly, from the want of
similitude; the field is now narrowed for the combat,&mdash;the
argument is brought, in his estimation, to <em>one
nation</em> only.</p>

<p>"<em>Lastly</em>, we come to the Egyptian. The point of
resemblance upon which the great stress has been laid,
is the Pyramid. The pyramidal form is one which
suggests itself to human intelligence <em>in every country</em>,
as the simplest and surest mode of <em>erecting a high
structure</em> upon a solid foundation."</p>

<p>We grant that the first suggestion of an habitation
would be of a pyramidal character, as instanced in the
tents of wandering tribes, formed by poles rising from
a base, more or less broad, and meeting in a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
centre; but we deny that the "pyramidal form" is one
followed "in every country," as a principle for rearing
"a high structure." If it was so generally practised,
why is Egypt the <em>only country</em> where it is found?
Why did not China, Japan, Hindustan, Greece, and
Rome practise it? Egypt alone claims it as an Architectural
practice,&mdash;the principle of the Pyramid identifies
her amid the wreck of Empires,&mdash;it stands out
on her <em>tableau</em> of History as the prominent characteristic,&mdash;it
was, and is, nowhere found but in the
Nation of the Nile, and now in the Ruins of Ancient
America! In the latter country the Aborigines modified
and improved upon the original; but sufficient is
shewn there, even in the base of the pyramid, to proclaim
the association of the builders with Egyptian
<em>knowledge</em>; nor does it follow that the Architects of
Palenque should have been, of necessity, Egyptians.</p>

<p>"The pyramidal form cannot be regarded as a
ground for assigning <em>a common origin to all people</em>,
among whom structures of that <em>character</em> are found,
unless the similarity is preserved in its most striking
features."</p>

<p>The Traveller says, "to all people." [<em>i. e.</em> nations]
Why, his own rejections prove that <em>no other people</em>
practised the pyramid but the Egyptian,&mdash;upon that
fact is he now arguing; for having failed to find the
pyramidal form in all the nations of the earth, he says,
"<em>Lastly</em>, we come to the Egyptian."</p>

<p>If in America <em>an entire</em> pyramid, from base to apex,
had been found, he would not have rejected the useless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
mass, but instantly have claimed it for Egyptian;
<em>or of that nation only</em>, having intimate knowledge of,
and association with, that country. Why then reject,&mdash;or
rather why does he not bring forward the same
reasoning when <em>the essential part</em> of the pyramid is
found there? It will be shewn why he did not advance
it.</p>

<p>"The Pyramids [of Egypt] are peculiar and uniform,
and were invariably erected for the same uses
and purposes, so far as those uses and purposes are
known. They are all square at the base, <em>with steps
rising</em> and diminishing until they come to a point."</p>

<p>The general truth of the previous quotation is apparent;
but that the Pyramids of Egypt had "<em>steps</em>" in
their <em>original</em> construction, cannot be supported by any
History, or by the absolute facts visible even at the
present day. <em>All their sides were smooth</em>; and commencing
at the apex in placing the facial stones, the
"<em>steps</em>" were used as successive scaffolds from the base
to the top. On the following page to the above extract,
Mr. Stephens contradicts his own reasoning, and
when that can be proved in the work of any Author,
no other refutation of a false conclusion is required.
We have shewn that he says the Egyptian Pyramids
had "<em>steps rising</em>" and in the very next page he
writes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Herodotus says, that in his time [484 <small>B. C.</small>] the
great Pyramid was coated with stone, <em>so as to present
a smooth surface</em>&mdash;[consequently <em>no</em> "steps rising"]&mdash;on
all its sides from the base to the top. The second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Pyramid of Ghizeh, called the Pyramid of Cephrenes,
<em>in its present condition</em> (1842), presents on the <em>lower</em>
part ranges of steps, with an accumulation of <em>angular</em>
[triangular] stones at the base, which <em>originally</em> filled
up the interstices between the steps, but have fallen
down. <em>In the upper part</em> the intermediate layers are
still in their places, and <em>the sides present a smooth surface
to the top</em>. [Thus is Herodotus confirmed.] There
is no doubt that <em>originally</em>, every Pyramid of Egypt
<em>was built with its sides perfectly smooth</em>. <em>The</em> <small>STEPS</small>
<em>formed no part of the plan</em>! [This is true, but a
direct denial of himself.] It is in this state only that
they ought to be considered, and in this state <em>any possible
resemblance</em> between them and what are called
the Pyramids of America, <em>ceases</em>!"</p>

<p>Now not only does the Traveller contradict himself
in writing of the original character of the Egyptian
Pyramids, but worse,&mdash;a direct denial of himself upon
the ground that the American cannot be Egyptian, because
all "resemblance ceases" upon contemplating the
<em>sides</em> of the structures of both countries in their original
character,&mdash;or in other words, if the American
Pyramid (or any part of it) had been derived from
Egypt, the sides would have been faced with stone, so
as to present a smooth surface. Granted. Here follows,
then, his own description, where the fact of identity is
established at Palenque!</p>

<p>"The Palace [Temple] stands on an artificial elevation
of an oblong form, forty feet high, three hundred
and ten feet in front and rear, and two hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sixty feet on each side. <em>This elevation</em> [pyramidal]
<em>was formerly faced with stone, which has been thrown
down</em> by the growth of trees."</p>

<p>We have here a distinct and an admitted analogy
between the original characteristic of the Egyptian
and the American Pyramids,&mdash;proved upon the very
point [the sides] brought forward by him to negate
the proposition, and from his own words. Again; at
the base of the Pyramid of Cephrenes (Egypt), the
triangular stones that formed the smooth sides are still
perceptible; so, also, are they to be seen at the base of
the Pyramid of Palenque,&mdash;each stone an oracular witness
against his "conclusive consideration." He objects
to similitude upon another ground, and again
refutes himself,&mdash;viz.:</p>

<p>"The Pyramids of Egypt are all square at the base,&mdash;the
nearest approach to this <em>is at Copan</em>; but even
at that place there is no entire Pyramid standing alone
and disconnected,&mdash;<em>nor one with four sides complete</em>,
but only <em>two</em>, or at most <em>three sides</em>, and intended to
form part of other structures."</p>

<p>At Copan (as we have shewn) the very measurement
of the base is within a few feet and (from errors
in sum total by different authors) may justly be regarded
as identical in size with the great Pyramid of
Egypt. It has, it is true, but three sides (pyramidal);
the fourth being on the river, consists of a perpendicular
wall, identical in height to the sea-wall of Tyrus.
In Egypt they had no river-walls that were perpendicular.
But why does he select Copan only, to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
whether <em>four sides</em> existed? Why not again review
Palenque? His <em>motive</em> is not concealed with the proverbial
ingenuity of his country; for at Palenque the
<em>four</em>-sided pyramidal structure is found, both in his
description and in his map of locality, where no less
than <em>five</em> "Casas" (houses) are presented on pyramidal
bases, having distinctly <em>four sides</em>, and three of them
square; nor is this all, <em>the Temple of Palenque itself</em>
stands on a pyramidal elevation, having distinctly <em>four
sides</em>!</p>

<p>As he read a "Congressional" document in the
Ruins of Palenque, by the light of "fire beetles," it
would almost appear that he formed his "<em>conclusions</em>"
by the same uncertain midnight lamps;&mdash;for from such
treacherous and deceptive flames has he illumined the
historical portion of his volumes; but yet the glimmering
of the "feeble light" is sufficient to discover his
hidden motive.</p>

<p>We now bring forward a contradiction more astonishing
than all the preceding: and but that his volumes
are before us, it would scarcely be credited from
the pen of any critic. Vol. ii., p. 439, he writes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Besides, the Pyramids of Egypt are known to have
<em>interior chambers</em>, and whatever their other uses, to
have been intended and <em>used as sepulchres</em>. These
(American), on the contrary, are of solid earth and
stone. No <small>INTERIOR CHAMBERS</small> <em>have ever been discovered,
and probably none exist</em>!"</p>

<p>In the <em>first</em> volume (p. 143), in writing of the pyramidal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
structure rising from the centre of the Temple
of Copan, is the following description, and which was
reserved from the details of that City, to prove this
contradiction.</p>

<p>"On each side of the centre of the steps is a mound
of ruins, apparently of a circular tower. <em>About halfway
up the steps</em> [of the pyramidal base] on this side, is
a pit [<em>i. e.</em> descent] five feet square and seventeen feet
deep, cased with stone. At the bottom is an opening
two feet four inches high, with a wall one foot nine
inches thick, <em>which leads to a</em> <small>CHAMBER</small> (!) <em>ten feet
long, five feet eight inches wide, and four feet high</em>.
<em>At each end is a niche</em> one foot nine inches high, one
foot eight inches deep, and two feet five inches long.
Colonel Galindo first broke into this <span class="smcap">Sepulchral
vault</span> ["chamber"] and found the niches and the
ground full of red earthenware, dishes, and pottery,
[Egyptian again] <em>more than fifty</em> of which, he says,
<em>were full of human bones</em>, packed in lime. Also several
sharp-edged and pointed knives of chaya; <em>a
small</em> <small>DEATH'S-HEAD</small> <em>carved in fine green stone</em>, its eyes
nearly closed, the lower features distorted, the back
symmetrically perforated with holes, <em>the whole of exquisite
workmanship</em>!"</p>

<p>This last sentence brings us to a specimen of <em>Gem
engraving</em>, the most ancient of all the antique works
of Art. Not only is the death "Chamber" identical
with that of Egypt, <em>but also the very way of reaching
it</em>&mdash;viz., first, by <em>ascending</em> the pyramidal base, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
then <em>descending</em>, and so entering the Sepulchre! This
could not be accidental,&mdash;the builders of that pyramidal
Sepulchre must have had a <em>knowledge</em> of
Egypt.</p>

<p>The foregone "self-denials" (so valued in man under
other aspects), lose all their virtue when exerted to
sustain fallacious premises. It might be thought that
enough has been brought forward to refute his conclusions;
but we desire to operate upon this subject, as
Tobin says, "Like the skilful surgeon, who cuts <em>beyond</em>
the wound to make the cure complete."</p>

<p>"Again," he writes, "columns [circular] are a distinguishing
feature of Egyptian architecture. There is
not a Temple on the Nile without them; and the reader
will bear in mind, <em>that among the whole of these ruins</em>,
<small>NOT ONE COLUMN</small> <em>has been found</em>! If this Architecture
had been <em>derived from</em> the Egyptians, so striking
and important a feature would never have been thrown
aside."</p>

<p>We admit the force of the preceding extract, so far
as relates to the circular column being a feature in the
Architecture of the Nile; and that they would also be
found in America, if the edifices in that country were
of, or "<em>derived from</em>," Egypt; while we admit this reasoning,
we at once deny the truth of the assertion, that
the round column <em>has not</em> been found in the Ruins of
Ancient America. This denial is given upon the unimpeachable
authority of Humboldt, who, in his illustrations
of the Ruins of Mitla, gives by writing, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
well as by pictorial description, the <em>circular</em> columns
distinct! The denial is also founded upon the grave
authority of Mr. Stephens himself,&mdash;for he (as Baron
Humboldt) testifies to the fact both by pen and pencil.
First, will be quoted from his pen. In vol. ii., p. 428,
in writing of the Ruins of Uxmal, he says&mdash;</p>

<p>"At the South-east corner of this platform [of the
Temple] is <em>a row of</em> <small>ROUND PILLARS</small>, <em>eighteen inches
in diameter</em>, and three or four feet high [broken], extending
about one hundred feet along the platform; and
these were the <em>nearest approach</em> (!) <em>to pillars or
columns</em> that we saw in all our exploration of the
ruins of that country."</p>

<p>Now in the name of Reason, and all its attributes,
could there be a "nearer approach" <em>to circular columns</em>,
than "<em>round pillars</em>?" Are they not identical? The
proposition can only be answered in the affirmative;
and as a consequence, it becomes absolute from the
identity. Again&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the middle of the terrace, along an avenue leading
to a range of steps, was <em>a broken round pillar</em>,
inclined and falling, with trees growing around it."</p>

<p>We will now refer to his map, or ground-plan of
the Temple of Uxmal, drawn by his artist, the accurate
Catherwood&mdash;(vol. ii., p. 428-9). On that plan
there are <em>two rows of circular columns</em> in parallel
lines,&mdash;one row is perfect, and contains eleven columns,
the other is imperfect, and presents six columns; but, as
dotted on the plan, and when the parallel lines were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in ruin, contained twenty-two "round pillars:" though
from the appearance of the ground-plan, it is almost
demonstrated that the two rows of columns were continued
around the entire platform-terrace, forming a
grand Colonnade, like those of Palmyra, or that facing
the church of St. Peter's at Rome, but a square instead
of a circular area. The columns at Uxmal are given as
"eighteen inches in diameter;" this multiplied by
eight (the medium calculation) would give each an
altitude of twelve feet. On the plan (by measuring
from the scale given) the line of one row of the
columns extends one hundred and forty feet, its parallel
the same; each column is ten feet from its associate;
the same distance exactly is between the parallel rows,
thus proving a perfect knowledge of Architectural design!
Pursuing the same scale of measurement (as
the ground-plan authorizes), the entire Colonnade of
Uxmal contained originally, <em>two hundred and thirty
circular columns</em>! In the centre of the area in front
of the Temple (and holding the same locality as the
single Obelisk in front of St. Peter's, at Rome), is the
ruin of the solitary "broken round Pillar," and compared
with the other columns on the Map, is <em>six feet
in diameter</em>, and this multiplied by <em>ten</em> (for capital and
ornament on the summit,&mdash;perhaps originally an emblem
of the Sun), would give this single column an
altitude of <em>sixty feet</em>! This is a <em>circular</em>, not a square
column. The foregone Architectural analysis is not
given by Stephens, but we have taken as a basis the
rude ground-plan given, and have thus resuscitated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Colonnade of Uxmal, which formed the approach to
the great Temple.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>On the Map of the ruin now under consideration,
and directly beneath the "round pillars," is written the
following sentence by Stephens himself, to illustrate
the meaning of the circular dots on the plan,&mdash;the
words are, "<em>Remains of Columns</em>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>How can he then reconcile from his own descriptions,
that "not one Column has been found?" "If," says
he, "this Architecture had been derived from the
Egyptians, so striking and important a feature [<em>i. e.</em>
circular Columns] would never have been thrown
aside." Well then, the "important feature" has <em>not</em>
"been thrown aside," and consequently from his own
reasoning, the Architecture was (conjoined with the
pyramidal bases) "<em>derived</em> from the Egyptian." We
believe distinctly, that the Architecture was "derived
from"&mdash;in other words&mdash;<em>borrowed</em> from,&mdash;the edifices
of the Nile;&mdash;but, not built by the Egyptians themselves.
In regard to another branch of Art, he commits
himself in the same manner as when writing of
Architecture.</p>

<p>"Next, as to Sculpture. The idea of resemblance
in this particular has been so often and so confidently
expressed, that I almost hesitate to declare the total
want of similarity."</p>

<p>There should indeed be hesitation upon a subject,
so capable of denying a conclusion, directly opposed to
occular demonstration.</p>

<p>"If there be any resemblance [to the Egyptian]
at all striking, it is only that the figures, are in <em>profile</em>, and
this is equally true of all good Sculpture in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bas-relievo</i>."</p>

<p>Why does he select "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bas-relievo</i>
bring forth <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alto-relievo</i>,&mdash;also,&mdash;for they are both
found in Egypt and America. The Altar at Copan,
and the walls at Palenque present <em>profile</em> figures and
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alto-relievo</i>,&mdash;so does the Vocal Memnon of Thebes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and the walls of Egypt: at Palenque the two figures
grouped at the Altar (of Casa, No. 3) are in profile,
and face to face, with the Mask of Saturn between
them, and holding the same general position as the two
figures of the Vocal Memnon,&mdash;who are also face to
face, and in profile,&mdash;but instead of the mask, they have
the Egyptian Tau <b>T</b> between them, and in the act of
binding it with the lotus plant. But he objects to
similitude apparently from the want of analogy in the
physiognomy, or profile characteristics of the relative
figures of Egypt and America. This certainly then
must prove that they were a different people; this we
distinctly believe;&mdash;but, that that people had knowledge
of Egyptian Architecture and Sculpture, <em>from
commercial intercourse with the Nile</em>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alto-relievo</i>
Sculpture is in America and Egypt:&mdash;in the former
country, on the Idol-columns of Copan; in the latter
nation, upon the Capitals of the Temple Columns;&mdash;and
in both countries the faces are <em>not in profile</em>, but
full front. The profile figures being on Temples, were
supposed to be <em>deified</em>, and consequently the facial
outlines were represented different from human outline.</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;What are the Obelisks of Egypt? Are
they not <em>square columns</em> for the facility of Sculpture?
and of what form are the isolated columns at Copan?
Are they not <em>square</em>, and for the same purpose of facility
in Sculpture with which they are covered, and
with workmanship "as fine as that of Egypt?" This
is a point that Mr. Stephens has passed over without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
even a comment! The Columns of Copan stand
detached and solitary,&mdash;the Obelisks of Egypt do the
same, and both are square (or four-sided) and covered
with the art of the Sculptor. The analogy of being
derived from the Nile is perfect,&mdash;for in what other
Ruins but those of Egypt, and Ancient America, is the
<em>square sculptured Column</em> to be found? He affects
to despise the Idol-Obelisks of Copan, because they do
not tower in a single stone, "ninety-feet" in height like
those of Egypt,&mdash;that they could not "be derived
from" the latter country, because they are only one-sixth
of the altitude of their prototypes!</p>

<p>Has Mr. Stephens then travelled amid the giant
Ruins of Memphis and Thebes, and gazed upon the
Pyramids of Ghizeh, unconscious of <em>their</em> history, as of
the Ruins in America? Has he yet to learn, that captives
and prisoners of war, numbering their thousands,
by tens and hundreds, built the former? <em>Freemen
built the latter, and consequently they are less in
grandeur!</em> Strange and original as this assertion
may appear, it is no less philosophically, than historically
true. What points out Egypt from the wreck
of Empires, even at this day?&mdash;her Colossal Pyramids
and Temples! What preserves ancient Rome amid
all the Ruins of Italy, and in present grandeur?&mdash;her
giant Coliseum! Who built these wonders of even
the modern world? Cheops and Sesostris, Vespasian
and Titus? They indeed commanded that they
should be erected as trophies of their power;&mdash;but,
who were the <em>workmen</em>, the actual builders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
labourers? There is not a Pyramid, or Temple of
Egypt, upon which the hand of a Freeman aided in
building! <em>Millions of Captives</em>, made by the Egyptian
kings, and especially by Sesostris, during his nine years
foreign warfare, were sent to Egypt, from Arabia,
Africa, and Asia,&mdash;his pride and vainglory were, that
posterity should know his Conquests <em>by the magnitude
of his Edifices,&mdash;for being built by his Captives</em>, modern
art might easily realize the extent, and to him, grandeur
of his victories. The useless, and unsupporting
Pyramid of the Nile, may well serve for the emblem
of Cheops, or the vainglorious Sesostris! Who
were the builders and labourers of the Coliseum?
<em>Ninety-seven thousand captives, and believers in The
Only God!</em> That human slaughterhouse of Rome,
is cemented from its base to its cornice, with the sighs
and blood of Jerusalem! <em>When</em> <span class="smcap">Liberty</span> <em>lays the
corner-stone</em>,&mdash;Utility is the Architect,&mdash;Grace and
Beauty the Sculptors,&mdash;and Freemen the builders
and artizans: these combined, useless Magnificence
can never cross the threshold, or Slavery breathe
upon the Altar!</p>

<p>The absence of the Arch in all the Ruins of America
will, also, identify those ancient cities with a nation
having a Knowledge of, and contemporaneous with,
Egypt,&mdash;for the Arch is not to be found in the cities
of the Nile&mdash;nor was it at Sidon or Tyrus. The Arch
was invented by the Greeks, but seldom practised by
them, as they did not think it graceful,&mdash;the Romans
did, and consequently used it upon nearly every occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Not only does the absence of the Arch point out
Egypt as a contemporaneous nation with the builders
in America, (this is omitted by Mr. Stephens) but the
manner of forming their ceilings is distinctly imitated
at Ocosingo, Palenque, and Uxmal:&mdash;for the ceilings
there are formed by stones lapping over each other
(like reversed steps) till they reach a centre, or such
small distance from each other, that a single stone will
bind them. At Uxmal the ceiling is smooth-surfaced,
like a pyramidal, or gable-end ceiling. In vol. ii.,
p. 313, he says, "The ceiling of each corridor was in
this form. [Described above.] <em>The builders were evidently
ignorant of the principles of the Arch</em>; and
the support was made by stones lapping over as they
rose, as at Ocosingo," &amp;c. It will be remembered that
at Palenque, the principal part of the architectural ornaments
are of <em>stucco</em> and as "hard as stone." "The
whole front [of the Temple] was covered with <em>stucco</em>
and <em>painted</em>." The reader who may be familiar with
descriptions of the wonders of the Nile by Legh, Wilkinson,
and Belzoni, will recognise at once that "painted
stucco" is also Egyptian:&mdash;but, this comparison is
avoided by Mr. Stephens; as, also, the following artistical
fact and analogy, which is found at Memphis and
other cities of Egypt&mdash;viz., "On the top of one [<em>i. e.</em>
stucco figures at Palenque] <em>are three hieroglyphics</em>
<small>SUNK IN THE STUCCO</small>!" The following will not serve
to support his conclusions.</p>

<p>"And the most radical difference of all is, the Pyramids
of Egypt are complete in themselves: the structures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in this country [America] were erected to serve
as <em>the foundations of buildings</em>. There is no pyramid
in Egypt <em>with</em> a Palace or Temple upon it, [would he
have it on an apex?]&mdash;there is no pyramidal structure
in this country <em>without</em>."</p>

<p>From the foregone extract can any reader acquainted
with the Arts, fail to arrive at the conclusion, that the
builders of Palenque and Uxmal derived from the
Egyptians all that was good of their great edifices, and
<em>improved</em> upon the other parts? For what reader will
deny, that a Temple erected upon the lower portion of
a Pyramid, is an improvement upon the original, by
the association of utility? And being an improvement,
<em>it must have been by those acquainted with the Original</em>,
and as remarked in the following pages, what Nation
had the facility of being so acquainted as the Tyrian?
And as if in direct copy of the Egyptian, we have shewn
that the size of the pyramidal base at Copan is identical
with that of the great Pyramid of the Nile,&mdash;while
that at Cholula, in Mexican America, <em>is exactly
twice</em> the base measurement. It is scarcely possible
that these dimensions should have been accidental in
construction.</p>

<p>"There is then," he says, "<em>no resemblance</em> in these
remains to those of the Egyptians; <em>and failing here
we look elsewhere in vain</em>."</p>

<p>His conclusions upon false premises, would indeed
prove "no resemblance:" but, truth and her all-powerful
propositions are against him,&mdash;his own descriptions,
and those of his attendant artist crush him at every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
step,&mdash;they both prove "<em>resemblance</em>" in every Ruin;&mdash;at
Copan, pyramidal structures, idol-obelisks, and sepulchral
chamber: at Palenque, profile figures, and
square-based, pyro-foundations: at Uxmal the same,
with a Colonnade of circular Columns,&mdash;and at the
second city (Palenque) a stone <em>statue</em> is even found,
and from the engraving, Egypt, or her Tyrian neighbour,
would instantly claim it. Of this statue he writes.
(Vol. ii., p. 349.)</p>

<p>"We were at once struck with its expression of
serene repose, <em>and its strong resemblance to Egyptian
Statues</em>. (!) In height it is ten feet six inches, of
which two feet six inches were under ground. The
head-dress is lofty and spreading: there are holes in
[near] the place of ears, which perhaps were adorned
with ear-rings of gold and pearls. Round the neck is
a necklace: and pressed against the breast by the right
hand, is an instrument apparently with teeth."</p>

<p>In the wood-cut this "instrument with teeth" is no
more or less, than part of a muralled crown, and it may
have been, therefore, the Statue of the Guardian of the
City. The Tyrian Coins have the muralled crown on
the head of the obverse profile, which represents Astart&#275;,
the tutelary Goddess of the Tyrians and
Sidonians.</p>

<p>"The left hand rests on a <em>hieroglyphic</em>, from which
descends some symbolical ornament: the figure stands
on what we have always considered a <em>hieroglyphic</em>
(plinth) <em>analogous again to the custom in Egypt</em> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
recording the name and office of the hero, or other
person represented."</p>

<p>In the last quotation but one, he distinctly uses the
word "resemblance," preceded by that of "strong," to
enforce the similitude to the Egyptian; and in the
last quotation he says, that the hieroglyphical plinth
is "analogous <em>again</em> to the custom of Egypt!" As he
has visited, and written of the statues of the Nile, we
will not gainsay his judgment even by a suspicion.
The statues on the building, surmounting the pyramidal
base at Uxmal, (Waldeck's folio) strongly
resemble the general character of the Egyptian,&mdash;the
head-dress and cape especially,&mdash;the difference is, that
otherwise than the lappet, hood, and cape,&mdash;the figure
is entirely naked,&mdash;whereas the Egyptian statues generally
possess the additional costume of the loin-cloth.</p>

<p>"They [the Ruins] are different from the works of
any other <em>known people</em>, of a <em>new order</em>, and entirely
and absolutely anomalous: they stand alone."</p>

<p>Every people (he argues) and the nations known
at the present day, by history, <em>or by ruins</em>, have been
searched in order to identify by <em>fac-simile</em> resemblance,
but in vain,&mdash;though Egypt, we have shewn, claims
the bases and many attendant analogies. What Nation
then ever existed (possessing <em>navigable</em> means) of
whose works by Architecture and Sculpture we have
no knowledge?&mdash;"That is the question,"&mdash;and that
answered, it will aid the solving of the mysterious
problem around the <em>Ruins</em>. Then here is the answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
without any fear of contradiction or denial. <em>The
only nation is the Tyrian!</em>&mdash;that name is used in its
triple or Ph&oelig;nician sense, and comprehends Sidon,
Tyrus, and Carthage,&mdash;not a remnant remains whereby
the slightest form can be traced, save the mere foundations
of their former greatness! Egypt was the neighbour
of the Tyrian, and consequently imparted her
knowledge through commercial communion.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Tyrus from their small locality
[<em>i. e.</em> the Island] were essentially a practical people,&mdash;they
had no space to build idle or useless edifices, like
those of Egypt,&mdash;<em>they had no captives</em>! The Tyrians
were of all people of the ancient world, best adapted
to imitate what was of utility and stability,&mdash;thence
their selecting pyramidal bases, as <em>foundations</em> for
their Temples in America, and which have preserved
those edifices, and the judgment of the builders, even
to this day, through a period of time beyond two thousand
years! It also evinced that acuteness and skill,
in applying means to ends, for which, as a Nation, they
were so renowned. In Section 3, of the Analogies, we
will establish from Scriptural History the early Architecture
(as to its style) of the ancient Tyrians.</p>

<p>The Ruins in Ancient America (and by that term
we mean <em>anterior</em> to the re-discovery by Columbus) do
indeed "stand alone:"&mdash;a "new order" to the modern
eye they may be&mdash;but over <em>two thousand years ago</em>,
the "order" might have been termed the <em>Egypto-Tyrian</em>:&mdash;and
reason, research, and analogies of
Religious and National Customs, will prove that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
name now given to this newly-discovered <em>ancient</em>
order is correct;&mdash;and that the moderns may not
only repeat the term, but, even aid the Science of
Architecture, by the application of the rules and principles
of utility and solidity, now discovered in the
Western Hemisphere!</p>

<p>Our review of his "conclusions" has advanced sufficiently
far for our purpose; for it must be evident that
a complete refutation of his deductions has been given,
and founded upon his own descriptions, and illustrations,&mdash;apart
from Baron Humboldt's and Waldeck's
works, or any humble commentaries of our own. It
will naturally be asked&mdash;"What could have been the
<em>motive</em> of such contradiction, and against himself?" A
hidden motive has more than once been hinted at in
the foregoing pages. O! love of Country! how inherent
is thy power in the human mind!&mdash;but, never
before was it exerted to the same extent as by our
favourite Traveller, as evinced in the motive for rejecting
all Nations&mdash;<em>except his own</em>, as claimants for the
builders of Copan, and her muralled companions of the
Western Continent.</p>

<p>Talk of the Dacii, and the Curtius, impaling themselves
upon the spears of the enemy, or plunging into
a gulph to close it,&mdash;why, our devoted Traveller does
more than all this&mdash;for he <em>survives</em> the shock and
fall!</p>

<p>The devotional lines <em>unfolding</em> the long concealed
<em>motive</em> for rejecting all other Nations, must not be
withheld, he writes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"I invite to this subject the special attention of
those familiar with the Arts of other countries;&mdash;for,
unless I am wrong, we have a <em>conclusion</em> far more
<em>interesting and wonderful</em> than that of connecting the
builders of these cities with the Egyptians, or <em>any
other people</em>. <em>It is the Spectacle of</em> <small>A PEOPLE</small> <em>skilled
in Architecture, Sculpture, and Drawing, and beyond
doubt, other more perishable arts; and possessing the
cultivation and refinement attendant upon these</em>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">not
derived from the Old World</span>, <em>but</em> <small>ORIGINATING
AND GROWING</small> <em>up here</em>, [America] <em>without models
or masters,&mdash;having a distinct, separate, independent
existence</em>:&mdash;<small>LIKE THE PLANTS AND FRUITS OF THE
SOIL&mdash;INDIGENOUS</small>!"</p>

<p>Temples and Pyramids defend your rights! Pericles
and Phidias protect the Arts!&mdash;for in the Western
Continent, without "models or masters,"&mdash;Edifices,
Architects, and Sculptors, as "plants and fruit"&mdash;or

<p>He brings forward different Nations to <em>father</em> the
Architecture in Ancient America,&mdash;he calls for "spirits
from the vasty deep;" but they will not come,&mdash;he
calls to the Hindu, Chinese, and Japanese, to claim the
Child,&mdash;they reject it. Europe does the same.&mdash;Greece
is not claimed,&mdash;although the meander border is on
the Sculptured drapery of the offspring. It must then
belong to Asia!&mdash;No?&mdash;well then certainly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
great Nation of Africa&mdash;Egypt!&mdash;what! the negative
again?&mdash;the writ to find the Parent is about to be
returned endorsed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non est inventus</i>, and the Architectural
Child to be declared fatherless,&mdash;for he passes by
the only Nation of all others that should have been
selected,&mdash;from their means of accomplishing the migration,&mdash;their
knowledge of art,&mdash;skill in imitation,&mdash;their
neighbourhood and communion with Egypt,&mdash;every
circumstance proclaims&mdash;Tyrus:&mdash;but,&mdash;no,&mdash;this
would not answer the purpose of the fascinating
Traveller,&mdash;his "conclusion" had a peculiar end in
view,&mdash;something National,&mdash;and with that love of
country so conspicuous (God be praised!) in the
Anglo-Saxon race, he discards Europe, Asia, and
Africa as the Builders,&mdash;to him there is a nobler idea,&mdash;that
the Temples, Palaces, and Altars,&mdash;Priests,
Kings, and People,&mdash;Architects, Sculptors, and Painters
belonged <em>to America only</em>,&mdash;that they were as the
"plants" "indigenous to the Soil,"&mdash;or, that they
sprung like Minerva, ready armed and equipped, as
the law of art directs, from the mental citadel of Jove
himself!</p>

<p>His "conclusion," which gives no distant antiquity
to these Ruins (but which is absolutely apparent), is
somewhat in analogy with that which may be supposed
to have been offered to a travelling Astronomer, by a
homestead-loving Cottager,&mdash;who declared that the
Moon could not be <em>ancient</em> and <em>inhabited</em>, because the
<em>freshness</em> would prevent both propositions. "Freshness!
How so, my good woman?" asked the Newtonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
disciple. "How so!" she replied. "How wise
you gentlemen with long telescopes are!&mdash;how so?&mdash;why
because there is a <span class="smcap">New</span> <em>moon every month</em>, and,
consequently, there would not be time enough for
people to be born,&mdash;or if they were to grow up like
'plants,' they would be cut down every month!&mdash;and
consequently they could not be <em>ancient</em>,&mdash;any how!"
But to be serious.&mdash;Our just pride of native land!
England,&mdash;as expressed in "The First Oration upon
the Life, Character, and Genius of Shakspeare,"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and
our impartial love (as a Citizen of the United States)
for the Nation claiming Washington as its founder, is
too well known and recorded in our humble Oration
upon her History and Independence,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;and in public
debate, discourses, and speeches, both in England and
America;&mdash;together with the feelings of duty;&mdash;and
gratitude founded upon hospitality and the Medallic
presentations received in both Countries, to admit even
of a question, as to our resolution to uphold their
glory and amity, at home or abroad,&mdash;and that without
fear or favour, from foe or friend! It was <em>the very spirit
of that love</em> for the country, which has graced us
by its Citizenship, that led us to detect the erroneous
"conclusions" of Mr. Stephens in reference to these
Ruins:&mdash;for the errors must be evident even to himself,
should these fervent but honest pages, ever meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
his perusal;&mdash;and appreciating as we do, the valuable
and interesting volumes he has given to the Library of
"Travels,"&mdash;good nature,&mdash;knowledge of the Arts,&mdash;united
with a justifiable, and a necessary independence,
called forth by the importance of the subject,&mdash;have
been the only means employed by us in criticising his
work.</p>

<p>In his last chapters, he seems to have forgotten what
he had written in his descriptions of the Ruins: and
that his "Conclusion" was a sudden thought,&mdash;and, as
proved, not founded upon that which preceded. It
could not be otherwise, for</p>

<p class="center">
"A change came o'er the spirit of <em>his</em> dream!"
</p>

<p>It is scarcely a question, whether he adds to the fame
of America so much, by making the Architects and the
Mexican Aborigines to rise up, as "indigenous" to the
land, and thence directly <em>opposing the Bible</em>,&mdash;the
first Parents, and the Diluvian Ancestors,&mdash;as if he had
traced, and proved them to be from scientific and accomplished
Tyrus,&mdash;or those of the North, from
"chosen" and courageous Israel, and following on their
track&mdash;to trace principles derived from an Apostle of
Christianity, together with the fulfilment of the words
of a Sacred Prophet!</p>

<p>This question cannot contemplate the fame of the
United-States,&mdash;either as a Nation or a People,&mdash;although
it does that of the Western Hemisphere generally;&mdash;that
of the Republic is consolidated with the
essential spirit and glory of the Anglo-Saxon and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Norman race, and consequently has no association with
the great Tyrian family, or that of Israel,&mdash;although
all the Nations of the Western Continent feel the serene
influence of the heaven-born power&mdash;Christianity.
That Faith (if we err not) was introduced into the
Western Hemisphere more than <em>five centuries</em> before
St. Augustine preached it in England.</p>

<p>In volume ii. (p. 442), Mr. Stephens expresses himself
in the following ingenuous manner,&mdash;<em>after</em> he had
formed his "conclusion," and which at once proves, by
his own words, that he did not sufficiently investigate
his subject. He writes&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>I shall not attempt to inquire into the Origin of
this people,&mdash;from what country they came,&mdash;or when,
or how!</em>"</p>

<p>With diligence and perseverance for our guides, we
have for years pursued the clue to this historical labyrinth,
and when the end is reached, we believe that
the <em>nation</em>, the <em>time</em>, and the <em>means</em> will be firmly established!
In regard to the first proposition, we conclude
this chapter by recording the new, and apparent
fact, founded upon descriptions which we have artistically
analyzed, together with the Analogies in the
following pages,&mdash;and beyond all, by the Bible itself
(as shewn in the next chapter), that the <em>Architecture</em>
of the Ruins of Ancient America is <span class="smcap">Egypto-Tyrian</span>,&mdash;and
that the original builders were from <span class="smcap">Tyrus</span>, and at
a period now distant more than two thousand years!</p>

<p>The subsequent proofs that will enable us firmly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
establish this proposition, will also announce the
startling fact of another accomplishment,&mdash;or fulfilment,&mdash;of
a sacred and quintuple Prophecy by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>!&mdash;and
consequently we shall claim that Prophecy, as
unimpeachable evidence of the truth of the historical
proposition of this Work.</p>

<p>This novel application of Prophecies by Isaiah
concerning Tyrus, will be discussed in the Second Book
of this Volume,&mdash;and in the concluding Chapters of
which, it will be employed as an absolute refutation of
Atheistical writings.</p>

<h3>ROBERTSON'S HISTORY OF AMERICA.</h3>

<p>A few words are required in reference to Dr. Robertson's
History of America. It was the present
writer's original intention to have formed a chapter
upon that Historian's conclusions, in regard to the
absence of civilization by the Aborigines of the Western
Continent,&mdash;or rather that portion contemplated
by Spanish history: but upon reflection, it was considered
unjust to his memory and well-merited fame, to
prove those conclusions were erroneous and false,&mdash;for
Robertson and the age in which he wrote (1770-80),
were in total ignorance of the existence of the now
celebrated Temples of Copan, Palenque, and Uxmal,
and the many Cities of ancient days newly discovered
in the Western Hemisphere. Refutation is unrequired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
by argument, when the basis of conclusions is founded
in ignorance of all the premises necessary to sustain
the superstructure:&mdash;his conclusions must, therefore,
necessarily fall to the ground,&mdash;and consequently his
Volumes upon America cannot now be received either
in the library or academy&mdash;(as far as concerns the
Aborigines, their works, or their ancestors)&mdash;as the
standard History of that Continent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">THE RELIGIOUS AND NATIONAL ANALOGIES BETWEEN THE
TYRIANS AND MEXICAN ABORIGINES&mdash;THE TRADITIONS
OF THE LATTER, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>


<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">ANALOGIES IN RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES AND IDOLS OF WORSHIP&mdash;SATURN&mdash;APOLLO&mdash;ASTARTE,
&amp;c.&mdash;THE EMBLEM OF THE CROSS,
&amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>In investigating the important similitudes contemplated
in this, and the following Sections of the present
Chapter, the word <em>Mexican</em> (for convenience) will be
understood to comprehend all the Western Continent
in its ancient condition&mdash;not essentially <em>North</em> America;&mdash;and
by the words "ancient condition" we would be
understood to mean, that period of time, anterior to the
landing of Columbus. [1492 <small>A. D.</small>] The Tyrian customs
will be brought forward, and then compared with
the Mexican. The history of Tyrus will not be required
here, that interesting branch of our subject is
reserved for the Second Book of the present Volume.</p>

<p>The Religious ceremonies of the Tyrians would have
been lost, but for their being preserved by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Carthaginians,&mdash;a colony from Tyrus,&mdash;and between whom
there existed the strictest union and friendship,&mdash;and
may justly be supposed to have practised the manners
and customs of the Parent country. The Tyrians, also,
would follow the customs of the Sidonians, and the
Canaanites, their original ancestors. Gathering, therefore,
evidences of Religious ceremonies from Canaan,
Sidon, Tyrus, and Carthage,&mdash;for they were all of the
Ph&oelig;nician family,&mdash;we shall include those nations
under one general term,&mdash;viz. <em>Tyrian</em>,&mdash;for the same
convenience as the term <em>Mexican</em> is used.</p>

<p>Not only will the Tyrian customs be gathered from
the nations mentioned, but from the Bible also,&mdash;so that
the reader will perceive, that the ground for sustaining
our superstructure is not a light, or a sandy one.</p>

<p>The Tyrians were essentially Idolators,&mdash;so were the
ancient Mexicans,&mdash;the former built Temples to their
plurality of Gods,&mdash;the latter did the same.</p>

<p>The Tyrians sacrificed human beings upon the unhallowed
dedication of their temples:&mdash;the Mexicans
followed this horror of a false Religion to its full extent;
for at the dedication of the last chief Temple of Mexico,
nearly <em>seventy thousand captives</em>, taken during four
years' warfare, were sacrificed to propitiate their
Deities!</p>

<p>The Tyrians devoted human sacrifices to the God of
War upon slight disaster or defeat,&mdash;the Mexicans had
the same "remedy for sorrow:"&mdash;and the many Altar-blocks
discovered amid the Ruined Temple of Copan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
(even now blood-stained) have been clotted with
human gore.</p>

<p>A very important God among the Tyrians was that
of <em>Saturn</em>&mdash;a description is necessary, on account of the
strong analogy to the Mexican Deity,&mdash;and that proved
by the Sculpture of the newly-discovered Ruins. This
strong similitude,&mdash;as a Rosetta-stone,&mdash;led us to the
first translation of the Architectural wonders. Cronus&mdash;or
the God Saturn,&mdash;among the Tyrians, was the
deity to whom were sacrificed the most beautiful infants
and children, and of the highest families;&mdash;it was
insatiate, ever asking, always receiving, and ever destroying!
This sacrifice to the Moloch of the Tyrians,
was derived from the Canaanites, their original ancestors.
<span class="smcap">Moses</span>, in warning his people to beware of
the false Gods in the countries they might conquer, and
referring especially to that of Canaan, says&mdash;</p>

<p>"For every abomination to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, which he
hateth, have they (the Canaanites) done unto their
Gods; <em>for even their sons and their daughters have
they burnt in the fire to their Gods</em>." [Deut. xii. 31.]</p>

<p>Again, in the third book of Moses,&mdash;the Lawgiver
says&mdash;</p>

<p>"And thou shalt not let any of thy seed [offspring]
<em>pass through the fire to Molech</em>." [Levit. xviii. 21.]&mdash;and
again <span class="smcap">God</span> spake by his Prophet, "Whosoever he
be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn
in Israel, that giveth <em>any of his seed unto Molech</em>,&mdash;he
shall surely be put to death: the people of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
land shall stone him with stones. And I will set my
face against that man, and will cut him off from among
his people;&mdash;because <em>he hath given of his seed unto
Molech</em>, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy
Name." [Levit. xx. 2, 3.]</p>

<p>In the New Testament this same God of the Canaanites
is called Moloch,&mdash;a name generally used in
poetry to express the demon of blood.</p>

<p>"Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch." [Acts
vii. 43.]</p>

<p>This was an ancient custom of the Canaanites, and
followed by their descendants, the Sidonians, Tyrians,
and Carthaginians,&mdash;it was, also, practised by the
Mexican Aborigines.</p>

<p>The Tyrian God Saturn, was represented in Asia and
Africa by a large metal Statue,&mdash;the figure was bent
slightly forward, with the hands extended, as in the act
of receiving, or soliciting:&mdash;the arms and hands were in
that position, that upon the child being placed in the
hands of the Statue, the weight of the smallest infant was
sufficient to displace its position, and consequently, it instantly
slipped from the hands of the Idol into a fiery
furnace,&mdash;ever burning beneath this God of Infanticide!
In this manner were the most beautiful
children of the Ph&oelig;nicians destroyed, as an offering to
the insatiate Moloch.</p>

<p>This Canaanitish practice, which was feared by
MOSES, was actually practised centuries after by his
People, for another Prophet speaking of the impending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
downfall of Jerusalem, and of her accumulated sins,
says,</p>

<p>"Moreover <em>thou hast</em> taken thy sons and thy daughters,
whom thou hast born unto me; and these hast
thou sacrificed unto them [false gods], to be devoured
[by flames],&mdash;* * *&mdash;thou hast slain my children, and
delivered them to cause them to pass <em>through the fire</em>
for them." [Ezekiel xvi. 20-21.]</p>

<p>Now the Sculpture of the Ruins in Mexican America
illustrates this very custom of the Tyrians,&mdash;and as
it was one of the greatest importance with that nation,
so has it received more attention than any other
subject.</p>

<p>It can readily be imagined how many stages in
the progress of this infanticide would be in the Tyrian
nation,&mdash;as thus,&mdash;the Mother bringing the child;&mdash;the
reception by the Priests,&mdash;the sorrow of the Parent,
and other incidents in analogy with the subject. The
Sculpture of the ruined Temples at Palenque, presents
many of the progressive steps towards a consummation
of the sacrifice,&mdash;as thus,&mdash;Female figures, erect,
adorned with jewels and ornaments,&mdash;each figure with
a child in her arms, not in the attitude of receiving a
Mother's nourishment, but held by the Parent in such
a manner, as if in sorrowful contemplation of her infant
victim:&mdash;the costume, also, is essentially important, for
the Tyrian Children were selected from families possessing
station, wealth, and power. Other female figures
are represented seated, and in the most melancholy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
postures, with downcast heads and looks, as if mourning
for that loss, which had made them Motherless!
In an inner apartment, believed to be the <i>sanctum</i> of a
Temple, is sculptured (in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">basso</i>) the resemblance of the
dread Altar, portraying the entrance of the fiery furnace,&mdash;<em>for
even the bars and grating are distinctly
visible</em>; a large and monstrous Mask, or demoniac face
is directly above the fire-grating,&mdash;presenting that of
the remorseless Deity. On either side of the Altar-furnace
and Mask of Saturn, is stationed a young and
an elderly Priest of sacrifice, both standing, erect, upon
crushed and prostrate human beings: the Priests have
their hands and arms elevated, <em>and each holds an
infant</em>,&mdash;raised up towards the demon-deity, as if in
the act of presenting the victims. The ancients (from
their Mythology) believed that their God,&mdash;Saturn,&mdash;devoured
its own children,&mdash;thence the worship,&mdash;and
those who sacrificed a child to him, were supposed
to be under his peculiar care and guidance:&mdash;this
Sculptured Mask,&mdash;has a hideous face,&mdash;distorted eyes,
a ravenous and distended mouth,&mdash;and its tongue hanging
out, as if athirst for infant blood,&mdash;thus presenting
a perfect portraiture of the child-craving appetite of
the Demon. It must be evident that the above <em>analogy</em>
is a most powerful one,&mdash;nor have the parallels
been strained in order to prove their equi-character;&mdash;the
analogy is so strong,&mdash;and apparently so convincing,&mdash;that
it cannot fail to reach the mind of the reader
with a conviction of their identity.</p>

<p>The Sculpture described, having reference to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Tyrian God&mdash;Saturn,&mdash;is, as we have stated, upon the
stuccoed walls of Palenque,&mdash;and, we believe, was
placed there as a record of a Religious custom, <em>practised
anterior to the walls being stuccoed</em>,&mdash;<em>for, another
piece of Sculpture represents the perfect overthrow
of this worship, by a more sublime Religion</em>, which
will be shewn in the third Volume. This discovery by
us, suggested the apparent truth, that the Temple of
Palenque was originally of stone, and dedicated to the
Sun (the elliptical <em>stone</em> tablet will prove that), and
that its <em>second æra</em> was the stuccoing of the walls,&mdash;this
fact we think can be established, to have taken
place about 350 years after the Temple was first
erected. As this subject involves that portion of our
History, which embraces the introduction of Christianity
into the Western Hemisphere, all argument to prove
the second æra in the Temple of Palenque, is reserved
for that Volume, devoted to the interesting and important
investigation.</p>

<p>The pictorial description given in the engraving,
furnished by Baron Humboldt, of the Mexican Calendar
found in the <em>plaza</em> of Mexico (buried in the time of
Cortez) has a direct bearing upon the Tyro-Mexican
Saturn, as represented at Palenque. The centre of the
sculptured Calendar-circle recorded by the great Traveller,&mdash;is
a horrid mask, or face,&mdash;nearly a likeness of
that at Palenque;&mdash;and one remarkable incident of
identity is, that each face has the tongue hanging out,
and by the muscular action,&mdash;in the same blood-devouring
manner. Now these Masks of Saturn (as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
have named them) were discovered many hundred
miles apart, which would seem to indicate that the
worship, or adoration of that heathen deity was a
general one, and practised by all the Mexican Aborigines.
The several Idol-obelisks at Copan, having the
Altars in front, were the personation of deities of less
denomination than Saturn,&mdash;but to whom, without
doubt, were sacrificed devoted victims and captives;&mdash;the
same also upon the pyramidal Altars of Cholula and
Quirigua. The Tyrians of Ph&oelig;nicia had many minor
deities claiming human sacrifice.</p>

<p>Another analogy will now be produced equally as
powerful&mdash;if not more so, than that having reference
to the Tyrian Moloch. The Ph&oelig;nicians had in their
several capitals a Temple erected to a tutelary, or National
God,&mdash;and that became the chief object of worship.
The Greeks copied this custom,&mdash;but, in the
Cecropian decision in the contest between Neptune and
Pallas, the Goddess was preferred,&mdash;and thus the "rejected"
on Mount Ida became the Guardian of the
Acropolis. The Daughter of Jupiter, in her character
of Minerva, was not only worshipped by Athens, but
by all Attica,&mdash;and under the name of <em>Intellect</em>, she is
now worshipped by every Nation! The Tyrians, from
their remote ancestors, the Canaanites, selected Apollo,
as their favourite and protective God,&mdash;although Jupiter
was the Chief of Gods with all the Heathens,&mdash;and was
worshipped under the name of Baal, or Belus, by the
Babylonians and Assyrians,&mdash;Ammon by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Egyptians,&mdash;Jupiter by the Ph&oelig;nicians and Greeks,&mdash;and as
Jove by the Romans.</p>

<p>The Sun,&mdash;(<em>i. e.</em> Apollo,)&mdash;as the Eye of Heaven,&mdash;was
worshipped by the Canaanites, Sidonians, Tyrians,
and Carthaginians as their protective God,&mdash;it never
left the great Ph&oelig;nician family from the time of
Canaan the "cursed,"&mdash;the grandson of Noah,&mdash;to the
destruction of Carthage by the Romans,&mdash;a period of
near two thousand years.</p>

<p>The chief Games,&mdash;or public festivals, of the Tyrians
were the Heraclian,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> those dedicated to Hercules-Apollo;&mdash;the
name was compounded by the Tyrians,
in order to personify the <em>strength</em> and <em>power</em> of their
God of Fire.</p>

<p>Apollo in the mythology of the ancients had many
attributes,&mdash;but the chief was that of being regarded as
the Symbol of the Sun, and as such, was worshipped
by the Tyrians, and had been from remote antiquity,
and even down to so late a period as the third century
of our own æra: for in 218, <small>A. D.</small>, <em>a Priest of the Sun</em>,
officiating at Emessa, in <em>Ph&oelig;nicia</em>, though a youth,
was elevated to the Imperial dignity at Rome, in the
person of Elagabalus,&mdash;and who, upon his arrival the
following year in his Italian Capital, endeavoured to
establish the absolute Worship of the Sun as practised
in <em>Ph&oelig;nicia</em>. In this he succeeded, but in the fourth
year of his reign he was assassinated, when the Romans
returned to the adoration of their Jupiter.</p>

<p>The Sun was, also, the chief worship at Palmyra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and upon the conquest and captivity of the heroic Zenobia
by the Emperor Aurelian, in 272 <small>A. D.</small>,&mdash;the conqueror
introduced the worship of Apollo at Rome:&mdash;but,
not as Elagabalus to the exclusion of Jupiter as
the chief Deity.</p>

<p>The celebrated Statue of the Apollo Belvidere, represents
the God in the attitude of having just discharged
an arrow from his "unerring bow,"&mdash;the attitude,
look, and general action, embrace that moment of
time during the flight of the feathered shaft,&mdash;all this is
merely symbolical of the Sun,&mdash;for the Statue illustrates
the triumph over the Deucalion Deluge:&mdash;as
thus.&mdash;After that Deluge the stagnated waters created
an enormous monster from the muddy slime, called
Python; (<em>i. e.</em> Pestilence)&mdash;Apollo (<em>i. e.</em> the Sun)
killed the monster with his arrows, (<em>i. e.</em> Sun-beams)&mdash;and
the Statue of the Sun-God represents, in his triumphant
look and lip, the ease and certainty of his
unerring aim and victory!</p>

<p>Apollo, therefore, is the Sun, and as such was regarded
and adored by the Tyrians; and such was their
devotion to the golden Statue of their God, that at the
last siege of their city (according to Plutarch), they
fastened it with chains of massive gold, and even nailed
the feet of the Statue, and thus doubly secured it to the
Chief Altar in the Temple of Hercules-Apollo,&mdash;who
being the chief object of worship by the Tyrians, (believing
that it was the <em>flame of life</em>,)&mdash;it cannot be a
matter of surprise, that such an attempt to secure their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
"source of existence," should have been made against
their ruthless invader.</p>

<p>The reader need scarcely be reminded that the chief
symbol of worship among the Mexican Aborigines was
Apollo, as viewed by the Tyrians. There is not a
schoolboy but is familiar with the fact (from the pen
of Kotzebue and Sheridan,) that the chief deity of
their Temple,&mdash;<em>the Sun</em>,&mdash;was "the God of their
Idolatry!"</p>

<p>"The faith (<em>i. e.</em> worship of the Sun) we follow,
teaches us to live in bonds of charity with all mankind,
and die with hope of bliss beyond the grave!" [Pizarro,
Act 2. Sc. "Temple of the Sun."] This analogy
in the chief worship of the Tyrians and Mexicans, in
illustrating their identity, is as powerful as a sculptured
Crescent upon a gravestone,&mdash;to impress the passer-by
with the belief, that a Mahommedan sleeps beneath!</p>

<p>There is no record of the Ph&oelig;nician or Tyrian
Banner,&mdash;but it may have descended to the Peruvians,&mdash;their
device being <em>an Eagle gazing upon a brilliant
Sun</em>!&mdash;it would not be an inappropriate Standard for
the Tyrians, considering their watchfulness of their favourite
God.</p>

<p>The Apollo-worship of the Tyrian and Mexican (together
with that of Saturn) we might enlarge upon, did
we not think, that the reader has already formed his
own affirmative conclusion of their identity.</p>

<p>As Apollo represented the Sun,&mdash;so did Astart&#275;&mdash;the
Moon,&mdash;and she was the Chief Goddess of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Tyrians, and was worshipped by the Mexican Aborigines.
Dr. Robertson distinctly states that the natives
of Bogota and Natchez worshipped Apollo and
Astart&#275;,&mdash;but in so stating he did not attempt to establish
any National Theory. The fact is, however,
given, as will be seen in the following quotation,&mdash;viz.,</p>

<p>"Among the people of Bogota (South America) the
Sun and Moon were, likewise, the chief objects of veneration."
"The Sun was the chief object of religious
worship among the Natchez," &amp;c. [Vol. v. b. iv.
p. 373-4.]</p>

<p>The latter, perhaps, were located upon the Mississippi,
when the Tyrian-Americans coasted the Gulf of
Mexico, as the Tribe of Natchez was the only one in
that part of the Continent, that practised the Tyrian
Customs.</p>

<p>Upon an <em>emblem</em> of this Goddess, will be established
one of the strongest analogies. The reader will be
startled at the following proposition,&mdash;but it is no less
the fact,&mdash;and it is given with peculiar force to sustain
identity&mdash;viz., <em>that the emblem of the</em> <span class="smcap">Cross</span> (as seen
at Palenque) <em>proves the Mexican Aborigines to have
been Tyrians</em>!</p>

<p>In the first book of Kings [ch. xi.] it is recorded that
<span class="smcap">Solomon</span> among his wives, had many Sidonians,&mdash;that
they "turned away his heart after other gods; and
his heart was not perfect with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his <span class="smcap">God</span>, as
was the heart of <span class="smcap">David</span> his father.&mdash;For <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> went
after [worshipped] <em>Ashtoreth, the Goddess of the
Sidonians</em>." (<em>i. e.</em> Tyrians.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in consequence of this departure from <span class="smcap">The
God</span> of Israel, that Ahijah prophecied to Jeroboam,
that he should have <em>Ten of the Tribes</em> of Abraham
for his kingdom, in the time of Solomon's Son and successor,&mdash;Rehoboam.
Ashtoreth is Astart&#275;: the Goddess
of the Sidonians and Tyrians,&mdash;they are one and
the same.</p>

<p>Without attempting here a refutation of the assertion
by atheistical or deistical writers, that the <em>monogram</em>
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> (<big>&#9767;</big>) was known <em>six centuries</em> before The Nativity,&mdash;it
will be sufficient for our present purpose to
establish, that the <em>Cross</em> was a Tyrian emblem, <em>more
than three hundred years anterior</em> to the time of Tiberius,&mdash;for
of that period (332 <small>B. C.</small>) we must again remark,
we are illustrating. It was, also, known in the
time of Solomon, for he worshipped the Tyrian
Astart&#275;,&mdash;whose symbol was the Cross,&mdash;and this was
more than <em>one thousand years before the Crucifixion</em>!</p>

<p>Here then is a more remote period for a knowledge
of the Cross, as an emblem, than that assumed by
sceptics;&mdash;it is brought forward because it is the
truth,&mdash;and why did not deistical writers trace it to
the time of Solomon?&mdash;they knew, if they did, that it
would prove a strong link in the chain of Christianity,
and therefore, for their own purposes they avoided it!
We will shew this as we proceed.</p>

<p>In Calmet's Dictionary of the Bible, is found a pictorial
representation of the Coins of ancient nations. In
the plates giving those of Sidon and Tyrus (both must
be viewed as one) is the figure of Astart&#275;, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
by the words "<em>The Sidonian Goddess</em>" in the old Ph&oelig;nician
characters. She is standing on the fore part of
a galley (emblem of Tyrian navigation)&mdash;full robed,&mdash;the
classic measure on her head,&mdash;a <em>branch</em> in her
right hand (emblem of peace and reward)&mdash;and in her
left hand <em>a long Cross</em> (emblem of war and punishment)&mdash;the
proportions are the same as the sacred one
used at Mount Calvary:&mdash;it is upright, and slightly inclines,
like a sceptre, across the inner part of the upper
arm of the Goddess. The following are Calmet's remarks
on the Coins.</p>

<p>"No. 4. <span class="smcap">Astarte</span>,&mdash;<em>holding the Cross</em>;&mdash;standing
on a Ship (galley): the measure on her head," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"No. 12. <span class="smcap">Astarte</span> standing in her Temple,&mdash;<em>holding
the long Cross in her hand</em>&mdash;the <em>shell</em>, supposed to
allude to the Tyrian dye;&mdash;in the exergue,&mdash;An Altar
(<em>i. e.</em> of perpetual fire) burning before the Temple," &amp;c.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the above manner of alluding
to the Cross of the Tyrian Goddess, is too positive (and
with the coins as witnesses) to admit even of a doubt
of its being an emblem of the Tyrians, and many centuries
before the period contemplated by this volume,
viz. 332 <small>B. C.</small> They then possessed the Cross, and
among the ancients they appear to have been the only
people,&mdash;with the exception of the Egyptians, who
probably <em>copied</em> it from the Ph&oelig;nicians, to illustrate
their own worship of the Moon,&mdash;the Egyptian emblem
was thus&mdash;( <big>&#9792;</big> )&mdash;and this has been falsely called the
sacred monogram,&mdash;for the Moon is shewn by the
circle&mdash;and the Cross was her general emblem.</p>

<p>Astart&#275; carried a Cross merely as an emblem of <em>punishment</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
as her olive, or palm-branch was emblematical of
<em>reward</em>,&mdash;Solomon worshipped her, and <em>her attributes</em>,
upon his leaving the <span class="smcap">One God</span>:&mdash;from David descended
the husband of The Saviour's Mother, as, also, the
Virgin herself, and <em>after the Crucifixion, the Cross
became the emblem of Salvation</em>!&mdash;and was no more
viewed as a Symbol of Idolatry, as in the time of
David's Son, or of a degraded death as in the time of
Tyberius:&mdash;may there not, in this very change of the
character of the emblem, in regard to its attribute of
worship,&mdash;from punishment to <em>atonement</em>, and by the
converted disciples from the same "chosen people," be
a mysterious token of the great precept by the Divine
<span class="antiqua">GOD</span>,&mdash;that from Evil cometh Good? We believe
every thing tending to the Glory of the <span class="antiqua">CREATOR</span>:
and even if the <em>monogram</em> used by Constantine did
exist centuries before the time of <span class="antiqua">CHRIST</span>,&mdash;but which
we deny,&mdash;yet viewing that subject with an eye of
faith it would be found to illustrate the Prophets,
and not detract from them or their Prophecies. We
have digressed,&mdash;the reader requires no apology,&mdash;the
subject will speak for us.</p>

<p>In the Mexican Ruins numerous instances are found
of the Cross,&mdash;it is in Sculpture and Stucco:&mdash;some
small apertures bear the same form, as thus, &#10010;&nbsp;:&mdash;the
lower part being inconvenient for its specific adaptation,&mdash;it
was not, therefore, used. In one of the minor
temples at Palenque, <em>the Cross with the lower part is
distinct</em>, and in full proportion,&mdash;thus proving the
"long Cross" of Astart&#275;,&mdash;the Tyrian Goddess,&mdash;to be
upon those Ruins. But without that&mdash;(for we desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
reserve the <em>sculpture</em> containing the long Cross for a
future application)&mdash;the numerous Crosses, of a minor
character upon other Ruins are sufficient to testify to
the worship, or knowledge of Astart&#275;, and her symbolical
attributes being known to the Mexican Aborigines.</p>

<p>Another analogy is in the Altars of perpetual fire,&mdash;and
their being watched by the Virgins of the Sun.
This was practised by the Tyrians as a branch of their
worship of the God of Fire&mdash;Apollo. The Roman
Vestals were copied from those of Ph&oelig;nicia. The
same horrid punishment attended the loss of virtue by
a Virgin of the Sun, both in Tyrus and Mexico,&mdash;this
was also imitated by the Romans.</p>

<p>We have no history tracing the (to us) obscene
worship of <span class="smcap">Priäpus</span> (<em>i. e.</em> Baal-peor) to the Tyrians,&mdash;<em>nor
was it found among the Mexicans</em>,&mdash;though it was
practised by the Egyptians,&mdash;and even by the all-accomplished
Greeks,&mdash;this was over 2000 years ago.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The <em>non-existence</em> of this generative and religious
worship by both Tyrians and Mexicans,&mdash;although
practised by other ancient nations,&mdash;must be regarded
as another proof of identity:&mdash;for identity can be proved
by a negative,&mdash;with equal power to an affirmative
custom. The strong analogies in Religion must be
apparent to the reader.</p>

<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">NATIONAL AND POLITICAL ANALOGIES&mdash;HISTORICAL AND TRADITIONAL&mdash;A
TRANSLATION OF THE HIEROGLYPHICAL ALTAR OF
COPAN, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>History proves the fact that the higher orders of
animals and birds, have been selected as the symbolical
emblems of different nations,&mdash;as for instance, the
British Lion,&mdash;the Gallic Cock,&mdash;the Roman and the
American Eagle, and many others. The Dove was
the bird of Babylon and Nineveh,&mdash;this was natural,
as those cities were the most ancient, and nearest to the
time of the Deluge,&mdash;and consequently the Dove became
the apparent emblem of safety; and it is a strong
proof of the historical fact of the Deluge and the
"Dove." The next beautiful bird of a peaceful character
is the Swan, and this was selected by another
immediate branch of Noah's family&mdash;viz., the Canaanites.
It has already been shewn that the house of Canaan
was the original of that of the Tyrians. The antiquary,
Jacob Bryant, says concerning this emblem of the
Canaanites, "that where they, or their descendants
(<em>i. e.</em> Tyrians) may have settled, there will a story be
found in reference to Swans." Now when the above
learned writer penned that general remark, he little
thought that it would be brought to bear upon the
identity of the Tyrians in the Western Hemisphere;
and therefore, in its application, it is of greater authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
from that very fact. He says&mdash;<em>that where the
Tyrians may have settled, we may expect to hear some
story or tradition about a</em> <span class="smcap">Swan or Swans</span>. Admitting
this to be truth, (and he is quoted as authority upon
antiquities,) <em>then is there proof that the Mexican Aborigines
were Tyrians</em>, as the following incident from
acknowledged history will shew. About two centuries
before the Spanish Conquest,&mdash;the Aztecas,&mdash;(Mexican
proper) were oppressed by a neighbouring kingdom;
the latter demanded as a tribute, that the former
should bring one of their celebrated floating gardens
from the Lake of Mexico,&mdash;this tributary present was
accomplished, with great labour and difficulty. The
next year this demand was repeated, and with this
addition&mdash;viz., <em>that their emblematical bird</em>, <span class="smcap">the Swan</span>,
should, also, be brought with it, and in the Garden, sitting
on her eggs,&mdash;and that the present should be so
timed as to its arrival, that the eggs should be hatched,
when the Garden was presented to the King demanding
the National tribute;&mdash;this was actually accomplished,
<em>and the Cygnets came forth</em> as the imperious
Monarch received the present. Now the substance of
the above was recorded by the Spanish Historian over
three centuries since, and with no idea to establish that
those Aborigines were Tyrians;&mdash;it may, therefore, be
received as a record of fact,&mdash;at all events it came to
the Historian from the Mexicans as a "story" of their
race,&mdash;handed down from sire to son, as a "tradition"
of their ancestors. In those respects alone&mdash;"story
or tradition"&mdash;the proof of identity required by Bryant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
is completely established. "Where the Tyrians are
you may expect to hear some story or tradition about
Swans."&mdash;Well then, here is the "story" and "tradition"
together with the historical fact,&mdash;and Swans
form the material:&mdash;but, they have been dying in
music for centuries yet unregarded;&mdash;they have been
as a symbolical record buried in a people's Sepulchre,&mdash;and
which the opening of a Nation's tomb has alone
brought to light. The classic reader will remember,
that Jupiter assumed the form of the Bird of Canaan,
when he sought and won the love of Leda!</p>

<p>We will now endeavour to translate the Hieroglyphics,
and Sculpture, upon, and around, the Chief Altar
of Copan. We commence with the proposition
that the hieroglyphics merely explain the Sculpture,
and that if the Sculpture can be explained, the sense
of the hieroglyphics, as a consequence, will be translated.
If we shall read the Sculpture aright, we
believe that it will be found to record a National Act
of Friendship,&mdash;whereby the Tyrians had the power of
reaching America. We will not anticipate our History
by now stating the detail of that act of amity,&mdash;it will be
sufficient for the present purpose to mention, that the
act occurred between the Sidonians and the Tyrians,&mdash;it
was an act of friendship in front of death itself,&mdash;and
death in its most terrific form, both of torture and
of infamy.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephens, in writing of the thirty-six compartments,
or squares,&mdash;of hieroglyphics on the top of the
Altar, says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"They without doubt record some <em>event in the history</em>
of the mysterious people who once inhabited the
City" (<em>i. e.</em> Copan).</p>

<p>We believe it,&mdash;and that the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">basso</i>-Sculpture on the
four sides, as already stated, illustrates the hieroglyphics
on the surface. The <em>details</em> of the Sculpture must be
first reviewed, in order to establish even analogy in the
<em>accessories</em> of the Altar. 1st. <em>The "two Serpents"</em>&mdash;(and
the same are around the walls of Uxmal).</p>

<p>The Serpent with the Tyrians (who copied it from
their neighbours of Egypt) was their Agatho-dæmon,&mdash;or
<em>good demon</em> of the country,&mdash;and would naturally
be used to illustrate any strong act of faith, or friendship;
and as a mutual act of amity had taken place
between these two nations,&mdash;the Mother and Child,&mdash;for
Tyrus was "the Daughter of Sidon,"&mdash;it follows
that <em>two serpents</em> were necessary to illustrate the
compound act. We have seen an ancient Tyrian
Coin, on the reverse of which is a Serpent entwining an
Egg,&mdash;it may be translated thus,&mdash;an Egg is the emblem
of life, and it being very large upon the Coin in
proportion to the Serpent, represents the germ of the
Nation's life,&mdash;the Serpent by coiling around it, presents
the <em>good demon</em> (power or Spirit) of the Country protecting
the Egg, or Nation, from external injury by its
numerous embraces,&mdash;the warmth of which would,
also, bring it into active life. The Altar is described
as standing "on four <em>globes</em> cut out of the stone,"&mdash;now
a globe conveys the idea only of a perfect sphere,
but from the drawings of the Altar these "globes" are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
distinctly <em>oval</em>, and consequently represent the form of
<em>Eggs</em> and not "globes!" On the Coin above alluded
to, the Egg is a principal emblem, and that of life,&mdash;and
those symbols forming the Corner-stones, or foundation
of the Altar, seem to illustrate that the story of
the Sculpture represents the very <em>existence</em>,&mdash;or <em>rather
the birth of the Nation</em> in its present locality, (<em>i. e.</em>
Copan). This we believe is the fact, and the warrant
for the assertion we will hereafter prove to be founded
on the authority of Classical History itself. This
Altar we have ever regarded as the Key-stone to the
Arch, of these historical sepulchres, and architectural
wonders of the Western wilderness.</p>

<p>The Serpents and the Eggs then are essentially Tyrian
emblems.</p>

<p>In the description of the Altar one of the two chief
personages holds in his hand an "instrument" or
sceptre&mdash;but each of the lesser figures an "object"&mdash;which
in the engraving is a <em>spiral shell</em>. These shells, also,
illustrate the Nation of Tyrus, for the spiral shell is
found upon nearly all the coins of that ancient country!
It was placed on their coins in honour of the discovery
of the secret of the celebrated colour, called by the
ancients,&mdash;the Tyrian Dye. That renowned colour
was not made from any earth or mineral, but from the
purple murex,&mdash;or the dye <em>shellfish</em>. It was first discovered
by a Tyrian on the shores of Tyrus,&mdash;who, wandering
with his Dog, suddenly observed the mouth of his
faithful companion to be empurpled,&mdash;and upon investigation,
he found that it arose from the animal crushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
between his teeth, <em>a small shellfish</em>, just then
thrown upon the Tyrian beach by the waters of the
Mediterranean. Improving upon the discovery, the
Tyrians became so renowned for their dye used in
regal and costly mantles, that in commemoration of the
event, they placed upon their Coins the <em>shell</em>,&mdash;nor
was the original discoverer forgotten, for upon a
Tyrian Coin (Calmet, No. 16) the Dog is seen approaching
the Shell! Some writers have questioned
the manner of the discovery,&mdash;but the last-mentioned
Coin confirms the historical account.</p>

<p>The Shell was also adapted to personify the marine
character of Tyrus,&mdash;and it being upon the Altar may
be viewed as another emblem of that country,&mdash;which,
with the Serpents and Eggs, cannot have been placed
there by caprice or accident,&mdash;but rather with absolute
intent, having reference to an historical design in the
Sculpture. The figures are all seated "cross-legged in
the <em>Oriental</em> fashion." Their very position then substantiates
Montezuma's assertion to Cortez, that his Ancestors
many ages past, come from "<em>the East</em>."</p>

<p>One of the chief personages to the "negotiation," as
Mr. Stephens calls the group, has a "Sceptre" in his
hand,&mdash;and there is none in the hand of the other King
or Cadmus,&mdash;(as the ancient Ph&oelig;nician Chiefs were
called;)&mdash;this incident is another proof of the correct
reading of the Act of Amity; for at the time of its performance,
Tyrus had ceased to be a nation&mdash;but Sidon
had not,&mdash;the former had lost all her powers of safety,&mdash;the
latter retained them,&mdash;and could, and did extend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
them to her "Daughter," who is represented as presenting
a Shell,&mdash;perhaps the Secret of the "Dye"&mdash;as
a tributary offering to her Parent,&mdash;who appears on the
Altar more elevated than the other Chief figure. This
still further illustrates the fact of the single sceptre and
its application.</p>

<p>Believing, from the general and early character of
the Sculpture, that Copan was the first built city in
Ancient America,&mdash;we are still further warranted in
the belief from the definition of the Chief Altar,&mdash;for it
appears to illustrate in every particular, both by incidents
and emblems, the <em>last</em> event of Tyrus in its
Asiatic history, but which was the <em>first</em> event leading
to the existence of the Tyrians in the Western Hemisphere.
This important fact will be detailed in the
History of Tyrus,&mdash;and at the present moment we will
observe (without anticipating the event) that there is
nothing in the Sculpture of the Altar, at variance with
the illustration of that fact of History; but, on the contrary,
every particular of the Sculpture completely
defines the Nation and the incident. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">basso</i> sculpture
of the Altar would, also, indicate an earlier erection
than the surrounding "Idols," which are in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alto</i>.</p>

<p>An analogy is, also, found in the political divisions,
and the peculiar governments of the Mother-Country
in Asia and Africa, and her descendants in Mexican
America. In each Hemisphere there was a mixture of
Monarchies and Republics;&mdash;as thus,&mdash;Sidon and
Tyrus were governed by Kings&mdash;while Carthage, after
the death of her first and only Monarch&mdash;Dido&mdash;became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
a Republic, and remained so,&mdash;and this fact
created the lasting jealousy of the Romans. The same
was in the Western Continent.&mdash;Mexico and other Nations
were Monarchies, while other portions of the
country were Republics. This is proved from the fact,
that the most powerful war Montezuma the <em>First</em> ever
engaged in, was that, in which the <em>three Republics</em>
joined as a common cause against the brave, but despotic
Monarch of Mexico.</p>

<p>As a National analogy may be viewed the Military
character and locality of Copan,&mdash;this, also, strengthens
our belief that this city was the first erected,&mdash;for although
on the Altars no Sculpture is found representing
weapons of war,&mdash;and in a Temple to Religion there
should not be,&mdash;yet this Temple is but the centre, of
what may be termed the <em>Citadel</em> of Copan. The entire
Ruins (it will be remembered) are traceable for a distance
of "over two miles," along the banks of the
River,&mdash;and on the opposite side, at the distance of a
mile, and on an eminence two thousand feet high, (thus
overlooking every approach to the city,) is found <em>a
ruined Stone Structure</em>, and almost evident from its
locality, to have been originally a signal, or watch-tower.
The city is, also, built on the banks of the
River, <em>and above "the falls,"</em> thus forming a <em>natural</em>
defence against any approach from the Sea,&mdash;while any
attempt to reach the Citadel by water from the Source
of the River, was frustrated by the erection of a high
perpendicular wall ("nearly 100 feet"), forming a river
façade of "six hundred and twenty-four feet,"&mdash;(nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the eighth of a mile)&mdash;this is based upon an elevated
embankment of about "thirty feet,"&mdash;<em>and</em> was
formerly protected from any flooding of the river, by a
water-wall along the whole range of the Citadel-Temple.
The great wall is in ruins at the summit, therefore
many feet may have fallen down,&mdash;thus proving that
its entire height with the embankment (as before expressed)
must have ranged from one hundred and
forty, to <em>one hundred and fifty feet</em>. Now there is
nothing in Egypt (as a plumb-wall) to be compared
with this,&mdash;nor does the Nile of ancient days, possess a
perpendicular wall,&mdash;and there is no marine Nation of
antiquity that can lay the analogous claim to such a
wall, equal to <em>Tyrus</em>,&mdash;for her Citadel-city in Asia was
bordered by the waters of the Tyrian harbour,&mdash;and to
secure its safety from human invasion, or that of the
Sea, the ancient inhabitants of that Island-mart <em>erected
perpendicular walls, one hundred and fifty feet in
height</em>! Copan then possesses an analogy to the capital
of ancient Tyrus,&mdash;and as that was the <em>last city</em> left by
the Aborigines in Asia, it appears but natural that
they should endeavour to imitate it, in building their
<em>first city</em> in a foreign land. We submit that this is a
strong analogy, and founded upon justifiable reasoning.</p>

<p>The Wreck of an ancient Galley has been found in
Mexican America, deeply imbedded in the sands,&mdash;now
this must have been (upon a minute investigation) the
remains of a Ph&oelig;nician vessel,&mdash;for the Greeks and
Romans had no galleys on the Atlantic waters, or even
the Indian Ocean, until the time of Alexander,&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the Tyrians had,&mdash;and, as will be proved (in the next
Book of this Volume), nearly <em>one thousand years before
the Christian Æra</em>, and <em>again, six centuries</em> before the
period of The Advent.</p>

<p>Circumcision was practised in Mexican America from
two distinct reasons. 1st. From a supposition that it
was conducive to health; and 2dly, from a Religious
custom; this last fact will be required for the third
volume,&mdash;the former only will be here brought forward,
for the purpose of proving another analogy. Circumcision
was practised by the Egyptians, Ethiopians,
Tyrians, Colchians, and Cappadocians, upon the belief
that personal safety would be the result; and the custom
might, therefore, be viewed as a sacrifice to Hygeia,&mdash;the
Goddess of Health,&mdash;and in this sacrifice many
of the <em>females</em> of Egypt did not exempt themselves.
The custom, however, was <em>optional</em>,&mdash;<em>this is proved by
the Egyptian Mummies</em>!&mdash;There were no laws to enforce
it (except upon the <em>Priests</em> of Egypt), as among
the Israelites and Jews, with whom, as an entire people,
it was, and is, one of the most sacred customs, established
by a Covenant between The Father of the Universe,
and the patriarch of Israel. In the division of
the Land of Canaan between the Twelve Tribes, by
<span class="smcap">Joshua</span>,&mdash;the Tribe of Asher was located on the confines
of Sidon and Tyrus.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Joshua</span> re-established the
Covenant of Circumcision, after it had been purposely
laid aside by MOSES during the "forty years" wandering
in the Wilderness. It was, therefore, practised by
the immediate neighbours of the Tyrians, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
apparent to belief, that the custom was received among
the Ph&oelig;nicians owing to their juxtaposition with a
Tribe of Israel. The Egyptians received the custom in
a similar manner,&mdash;viz., during the sojourn of Israel in
Egypt. The Tribe of Asher,&mdash;and its customs, gradually
encroached upon the Idolatry and manners of
the Ph&oelig;nicians,&mdash;for we find (upon the authority of
Malte Brun) that the members of that Tribe (Asher)
were driven back from all the sea-coast to the interior,
by the Sidonians and Tyrians;&mdash;the custom, however,
in an <em>optional</em> character, remained with the Tyrians,&mdash;and
in that manner it was practised by the Mexican
Aborigines.</p>

<p>In viewing the above analogy, it must be evident to
the reader,&mdash;that in the fact of <em>optional</em> Circumcision
(no matter from what motive) another proof is seen of
the <em>two distinct races</em> in Ancient America,&mdash;for in the
<em>North</em>, as stated heretofore, where it is practised, it is
only in the form of a <em>Religious</em> rite.</p>

<p>The tradition of the ancient Mexicans as to <em>where
they came from</em>, is directly in favour of this work.
Upon Cortez asking Montezuma the Second, the origin
of the Mexican race,&mdash;the Monarch answered,&mdash;that
many ages ago they came from "<em>The East</em>"&mdash;(<em>i. e.</em>
from where the Sun rises)&mdash;and as he then was speaking
<em>in</em> Mexico, "<em>The East</em>" is at once defined to be
across the Atlantic Ocean. The coast of Ph&oelig;nicia was
always denominated "<em>The East</em>"&mdash;this is absolute on
the authority of Holy Writ, and in that definition, <em>Tyrus</em>
is distinctly spoken of: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"All the nations have I destroyed before them: and
in <em>the East</em>, I have scattered the people of the provinces,
even of <em>Tyrus</em> and Sidon." [Esdras ii. 12.]</p>

<p>Sahagun the Spanish historian, who lived nearly
sixty years with the Mexicans, and wrote about fifteen
years after the Conquest by Cortez (1520) relates, that,
from their traditional history, handed down from remote
antiquity,&mdash;<em>the Aborigines of the Country, first</em> <small>TOUCHED</small>
<em>at Florida,&mdash;then</em> <small>COASTED</small> <em>along, until they reached
the Bay of Honduras,&mdash;and they then</em> <small>LANDED</small>.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the terms "touched"
"coasted" and "landed" are phrases belonging exclusively
to Navigation,&mdash;this confirms the reply of Montezuma,
that his ancestors originally <em>came</em> <small>FROM</small> <em>the
East</em>, for by Navigation only could they come from
that quarter,&mdash;and as a consequence they sailed <em>towards
the West</em>, and across the Atlantic Ocean!</p>

<p>The tradition of having "<em>first touched at</em> <span class="smcap">Florida</span>,"
is as remarkable, as the means of Nature whereby it
was accomplished, which will be investigated and established
in the last pages of this Volume.</p>

<p>Cortez wished to sail around the Bay of Honduras,
the Point of Yucatan, and thence into the Gulph of
Mexico,&mdash;and inquired if there were descriptions of
those coasts. Montezuma instantly presented to the
Spaniard <em>Maps and Charts of the entire Coast</em>, and
from these, Cortez steered, and sailed in his perilous
voyage around Honduras, and by the correctness of the
Charts, he accomplished his expedition in safety. This
account he wrote home to his Emperor and Master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Charles the Fifth,&mdash;it is consequently history:&mdash;no argument
is, therefore, required to prove their Knowledge,
and that of their ancestors in the Science of Navigation;&mdash;and
what people in the Asiatic world were
such "pilots and mariners" as the ancient Tyrians? If
the Mexican Aborigines had sprung from a race (like
the Israelites of the North) having <em>no</em> knowledge of
navigation, it would have been impossible to have had
Maps and Charts from their remote ancestors, and to
have continued the scientific practice of that knowledge
among themselves.</p>

<p>This is another strong proof of the <em>two</em> races of Aborigines
on the Western Continent; and of the different
means whereby their migrations were accomplished.</p>

<p>Sahagun, also, relates that from testimony of tradition,
and <em>their historical Paintings</em>, that their ancestors,
<em>as a Colony</em>&mdash;arrived on the American coast (first
touching at Florida) <em>before the Christian Æra</em>! It
should be observed that this account by the Spaniard
was written over three hundred years ago,&mdash;it was then
laughed at,&mdash;but the time was computed both by the
Aborigines and Sahagun,&mdash;<em>the former</em>, as well as the
latter, had a knowledge of the Christian Æra, as will be
proved in the third volume,&mdash;That knowledge was conveyed
to them <em>after</em> the arrival of the colony;&mdash;and
nearly fifteen centuries before the conquest by Cortez!</p>

<p>The Ruins in Ancient America, together with relative
facts, prove that Sahagun's account in regard to
<em>time</em> is correct; and that their original ancestors <em>did</em>
arrive before the Christian Æra. The same Historian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
says, that from their historical traditions, the Mexican
Aborigines were originally a Colony;&mdash;which term may
be received as explanatory of their small <em>number</em>, and
that only,&mdash;for had they been "a Colony" according to
the modern and general acceptation of the word, there
would have been some Mother-land to claim her foreign
Children,&mdash;but, none appears upon the Books of
History.</p>

<p>They then arrived "before the Christian Æra,"&mdash;this
then places them in a positive position,&mdash;for the Nation
from whence they came, must have existed before that
sacred period,&mdash;and the Nation (as a people) must
have had knowledge of, and the means of Navigation,
since it is already established that they arrived in that
manner. The "mind's eye" must instantly glance at
the Tyrians, as the people having those means, and
being in existence anterior to the Christian Æra. The
Tyrians did compose that "colony,"&mdash;not sent forth from
their own land by care and affection; but, driven
forth (as we will prove) by terror and despair!&mdash;They
were the "pilots and mariners," and the "merchant
princes" of the desperate hazard:&mdash;their knowledge and
skill in navigation, were the champions daring the united
powers of Neptune and Boreas, and upon a Naumachian
arena, where a prow had never cut through a liquid
track: Neptune permitted the refugees to pass on to
freedom,&mdash;for the Ocean-God remains now, as when he
first received from Creation upon his broad breast, the
panoply of Light,&mdash;<em>scarless</em>:&mdash;and for all the wild wars
of Elements and Man upon that panoply,&mdash;the lightning's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
rapid shafts,&mdash;the iron-tempest from earth's artillery,&mdash;still
that bright armour&mdash;reflecting Heaven on its surface&mdash;retains
no impress from the fierce battery of the
Storm-cloud, or from Man's weaker power, or ambition!</p>


<h3>SECTION III.</h3>

<h4>ARTISTICAL ANALOGIES.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">ARCHITECTURE, SCULPTURE, AND PAINTINGS&mdash;THE PYRAMIDS OF
EGYPT AND AMERICA&mdash;THE ANCIENT TYRIAN DYE&mdash;THE TEMPLES
OF JERUSALEM AND PALENQUE, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Architecture and Sculpture of the Ruins, in
order to support this Epoch, must possess an undeniable
existence, and founded upon data, and strong analogy,
of having a character traceable centuries before the
Christian Æra. Four Sciences are required to be possessed
by the original nation,&mdash;viz., Architecture, Sculpture,
Painting, and <em>Navigation</em>. If we view for these
purposes Hindoostan, China, and Japan, the characteristics
of the first-named Sciences are totally different,
while the latter is wanting to the extent necessary.
Rome and Greece would present the marine power,
but the <em>Architecture</em> of those countries would claim no
affinity with that in America; for at Copan, Palenque,
and Uxmal, and all the Ruins, the Arch and Pediment
are wanting. Egypt claims at once the general character
of the Architecture, but not sufficient to establish
that it is strictly of a National order, as practised on the
borders of the Nile;&mdash;but, enough is shewn to prove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
that a People built those cities in America, who had a
<em>knowledge</em> of Egyptian architecture. If Egypt itself
had sent the "colony,"&mdash;(but from the want of the
means of Navigation it was impossible, and also a
record would have been found in Herodotus or Diodorus,
who wrote of that country about 484, and 44
<small>B. C.</small>:&mdash;if it had taken place prior to those periods, their
accuracy would have compelled them to notice it)&mdash;if,
we say, Egypt had sent a "colony," the Temples would
have been built like her own in every particular.&mdash;Pronaos,
Sphinx, and other characteristics,&mdash;but these
do not appear, or the slightest indication of them;&mdash;yet,
where the pyramidal structure and obelisk
(square-column sculptured) and circular columns are to
be found, there Egypt may be traced as having given
<em>knowledge</em> to the builders. The Pyramid of Caius
Cestius at Rome will illustrate this fact. No one will
say that that Pyramid is Roman architecture,&mdash;yet no
one will deny that the builder had a <em>knowledge</em> of
Egypt and her works,&mdash;and no Historian would claim
Rome to be Egypt, because a Pyramid was found there;
so in Mexican America, the Ruins partake of the Egyptian
character sufficiently to give the style of the Architectural
foundations to that of the Nile,&mdash;yet they must
have been erected by another Nation;&mdash;yet that Nation
must be proved to have a knowledge of, and intercourse
with, Egypt. What nation of all the earth enjoyed
this equal to the Tyrian? They were in weekly intercourse
with each other,&mdash;exchanging as men their sentiments,
and as merchants their merchandise, till one
general conquest overwhelmed both countries,&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
nation remaining subdued and tributary, and the other
dispersed and annihilated.</p>

<p>It is proved (we submit) that the <em>Sculpture</em> in
many parts, and especially at Uxmal, partakes of the
<em>Grecian</em> character, while the <em>Architecture</em> is that of
the <em>Egyptian</em>. This is a nice distinction,&mdash;but it
enables us to strengthen our belief that Egypt, as a
Nation, could not have been the builders, but they
must have been a People (we repeat it, to impress it
on the mind of the reader) having a knowledge of the
Nile and her edifices; to this may be joined, a People
having a knowledge, also, of the Greeks, since the
Sculpture at Uxmal is Grecian in design. The Tyrians
possessed this intercourse;&mdash;but, it is possible that
some few Greeks may have been of the Colony landing
on "the American coast" before the Christian Æra,&mdash;that
they may have gladly embraced the occasion, as
the only means of escaping death at the fearful event
which caused the Migration. From the same cause a
few Egyptians may have escaped, and joined the
colony in the same manner. The strangers on the Island
of Tyrus, would probably be those who had arrived by
water from a distance,&mdash;Egypt was one port of commerce,
Ægina another, and ambitious of maritime fame.
Ægina is selected for more than one reason. It was
an Island in direct intercourse with Tyrus, and the
Ægineans were renowned for their general knowledge
of the art of ornamental Sculpture, but not on so grand
a scale as that of Athens. The Ægineans were called
<em>myrmidons</em>, or <em>emmets</em>, from their patient perseverance
in the art of Agriculture and other employments,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
thence the <em>Tortoise</em> became their National emblem, the
slow but sure progress of that shellfish being a symbol
of their industry; it formed a double emblem;
viz., of their industry and marine character. Now it
will be remembered that the Ruins of Uxmal display
four <em>Tortoises</em> in stone Sculpture,&mdash;and one was found
detached, and buried in the Ruins of Copan.</p>

<p>Ægina was the first nation that coined Money, and
issued Medals,&mdash;Athens often applied to Ægina for the
execution of both. The Chief Symbol on the Coin of
Ægina was the Tortoise, for the reasons stated above:&mdash;now,
in Mexican America, an ancient coin, or medal,
has been found with the Symbol of the Tortoise on it!
It may have been buried by a citizen of Ægina (one
of the Colony), or by a Tyrian who possessed a coin of
the Island-rival,&mdash;but most probably the first proposition
is correct&mdash;viz., that it was possessed by a native
of Ægina,&mdash;for at Uxmal the <em>Tortoise</em> is there in
Sculpture, and the entire façades, interior and exterior,
are filled with ornaments <em>à la Grecque antique</em>,&mdash;and
especially that of the running square, or meander border,&mdash;while
the buildings themselves bear no analogy
to those of Attica;&mdash;thus proving almost to demonstration,
that <em>Grecian Artists</em> were authors of the <em>Sculpture</em>,
<em>Tyrians</em> the Architects of the entire edifices,&mdash;while
those of <em>Egypt</em> were authors of the <em>Architectural</em>
bases. The reader may think that this is the refinement
of investigation,&mdash;but, it is such as truth and perseverance
have authorized, and the historic importance
of the subject demands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tortoise is, also, the designation of the coins of
Thebes in Greece,&mdash;and from this fact, it is brought
home at once to the Tyrians, as a Symbol of their
country, as well as of Ægina,&mdash;and in all probability
(consulting data) Ægina copied it from the Theban
coin. The Ph&oelig;nician Chief, Cadmus&mdash;(all ancient
Tyrian Chiefs were so called) founded Thebes, and is
well known to have introduced into Greece, the letters,
or Alphabet of his own country; and without doubt,
at the same time, he selected the Symbols of his Native
land, to represent the Coin of his new City. The Tortoise
is, therefore, a Tyrian emblem, and is found upon
the Ruins in Ancient America.</p>

<p>Cadmus founded Thebes 1493 <small>B. C.</small>, and was consequently
contemporary with the first Lawgiver. Euripides
in his Drama of the "Ph&oelig;nician Virgins" thus
alludes to his arrival, as uttered by Jocasta:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent8">"Resplendent Sun</div>
<div class="line">How inauspicious didst thou dart thy beams</div>
<div class="line">That day on Thebes, when from the sea-wash'd coast</div>
<div class="line">Of fair Ph&oelig;nicia Cadmus on this land</div>
<div class="line">Set his ill-omen'd foot!"</div>
</div></div>

<p>We have suggested that Grecians [<em>i. e.</em> of Ægina]
may have been the authors of the Sculpture, and
Egyptians of the Architectural bases of the edifices,
because their respective styles are traceable in the
Ruins of Palenque, Uxmal, and Copan. This suggestion
is founded upon the possibility (and even probability)
of natives of those nations being at Tyrus, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
time of the departure of the Tyrians:&mdash;yet, it does not
follow, as a necessity, that all the Architects, Builders,
and Sculptors must have been of those nations;&mdash;for
although there does not exist in Asia or Africa any
Ph&oelig;nician Architecture, whereby a comparison can
be made, yet there does exist the undying record that
the Tyrians were builders and Sculptors from their
own practice, and that fact is founded upon the authority
of Scripture:</p>

<p>"And Hiram, King of Tyre sent messengers to David,&mdash;and
cedar trees,&mdash;and <em>carpenters</em> and <em>masons</em>,&mdash;and
they built David a house"&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> Palace. [2 Samuel
v. 2.]</p>

<p>Here then is a distinct and undeniable record of the
Tyrians being, not only carpenters (their Shipbuilding
proves that) but <em>Masons</em>,&mdash;and which in the original
Hebrew text is defined to be "<em>hewers of the stone of
the wall</em>;" and consequently they were <em>Sculptors</em>, as
well as <em>Architects</em>. Their building and adorning of
Solomon's Temple (as will be shewn in the History of
Tyrus) are additional facts, with the building of the
Palace of David, to put at rest any suspicion, or question,
whether the Tyrians themselves, unassisted by
others, could have built and Sculptured those edifices
in America. The <em>Israelites</em> had no practical knowledge
of Architecture until ages after the building
(by the Tyrians) of Solomon's Temple. 1015 <small>B. C.</small></p>

<p>The above quotation from Sacred History refers to
the year 1043 <small>B. C.</small>, and consequently centuries before
the time contemplated by this Epoch,&mdash;viz., <small>B. C.</small> 332.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Skilful knowledge, possessed, and existing for ages
before, by any nation, and upon any subject, would
naturally be improved upon and practised by descendants:&mdash;they
would also improve upon the Architecture
of <em>any other nation</em> with whom they had association
and communion,&mdash;and as Tyrus, as a People,
of all the ancient nations was a practical one, they
produced in America an improvement (and a great
one) upon the Architecture of the Egyptians. This
fact of <em>improvement</em>, and <em>alteration</em> of the original
order of Egypt, is another proof that the builders were
not essentially of that nation; but,&mdash;from a country
having a practical skill, and minds daring enough to
innovate upon any precedent, when <em>improvement</em> would
be the result.&mdash;That Nation was Tyrus.</p>

<p>We do not desire to advance one assertion, not capable
of being defended, and consequently will establish
that an improvement upon the Architecture of Egypt
does exist in the Ruined cities of Ancient America.</p>

<p>The first idea in building had its origin (without
doubt) from the Caverns of Nature, where Man would
be protected from the raging tempest:&mdash;and, from being
shadowed from the beams of Apollo by the spreading
branches of the forest, he must have soon felt the necessity
of converting the latter into more commodious
forms than those in which Nature had left them. To
huts made of trees and branches, festooned together by
their own foliage, succeeded more convenient habitations,
composed of upright and cross beams, the apertures
closed with leaves and moistened earth. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
these humble pillars of the forest, were derived those
beautiful Columns composing the five received orders of
Architecture. That of Egypt is not admitted into the
Classic group.</p>

<p>The interior of a cavern with the walls rising pyramidally,
gave the natural instruction for the formation
of a Tent,&mdash;poles rising from a broad base to a centre,&mdash;or
of a single one, with the canvass outstretched by
cords and fastened to the stakes driven in the earth;&mdash;such
were the Tents of Israel,&mdash;those of the Aborigines
of <em>North</em> America, and of the wandering Gipsy, in
the erection of their culinary edifice even to this day.
The Pyramids of Egypt are but majestic examples of
the same principle of construction,&mdash;viz., the corners
and sides of a broad base rising on an inclined plane,
until they meet and form an apex over a common
centre. This construction has given them that defiance
against the whirlwinds and sands for which they are so
conspicuous. <em>Water</em>,&mdash;that "sore decayer of dead
bodies,"&mdash;be they of "flesh," wood, or stone, can have
no effect in Egypt; <em>for there the rains do not fall</em>,
and consequently moisture cannot exert her gradual
but certain power;&mdash;in Ancient America this safeguard
to edifices is not granted by Nature,&mdash;but yet the principle
of the Pyramid has given duration, and proved
the existence of Nations in the Western Hemisphere,
traceable to centuries before Egypt mourned a Cleopatra,
who, as the living emblem of her death, became
the venomed and fatal Serpent of her Country!</p>

<p>The Pyramids of Egypt (symbols of self-vanity) rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
from a broad base to an <em>unsupporting</em>, <em>useless</em>, and idle
apex:&mdash;in Mexican America <em>the lowest portion of the
base is retained, and that only; and upon this simple,
but lasting foundation, are erected the perpendicular
walls of her sacred Temples,&mdash;Sculptured stone forming
the façades of the gorgeous edifices</em>! The point
of grandeur of design, is far beyond the useless masses of
the Nile; for there can exist no grandeur of design
without the association of utility,&mdash;physical or mental.
The radiant Sun itself would cease to be Sublime, were
it in design, or in its powers, to be devoid of its
manifold, and creative blessings! The Architect of the
Universe in forming the "image of Himself," and in
assigning to it the functions of physical power, so
organized them,&mdash;and the more subtle mechanism of
the brain,&mdash;that they should illustrate, that all action
and thought (apart from Religious duty) should be
directed towards utility and excellence!</p>

<p>The fact of <em>improving</em> upon the pyramidal Architecture
of Egypt, supports the apparent fact that Tyrians
alone were the builders of the edifices now under consideration;
for (apart from the perpendicular river-wall,
which is identical with the sea-wall of ancient
Tyrus) a new and distinct order, or style of Architecture,
is visible in those Temples, traceable from the
base to the Cornice or summit,&mdash;and from the compound
character, believe that we have correctly termed it
<em>Egypto-Tyrian</em>.</p>

<p>We will advance another reason for believing that
Copan was the first City built in Mexican America,&mdash;viz.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the <em>square</em> column (or obelisk) <em>only</em>, is found
there,&mdash;while in other ruins, excepting Palenque, the
<em>circular</em> is perceptible,&mdash;the latter are found at Mitla
and Uxmal,&mdash;thus establishing (almost conclusively)
that those cities were of later erection,&mdash;for the square
column is easier in formation than the circular,&mdash;and the
latter is produced from the former,&mdash;and consequently
<em>two columns</em> are made in producing the circular shaft.
The square is, also, better adapted, from its facial character,
for the purposes of Sculpture; as illustrated in
the Idol-obelisks at Copan,&mdash;and that which would be
the simplest in construction, and giving the greatest
facility for its peculiar adaptation, would naturally be
selected by a People for their first Temple:&mdash;yet,
reserving to themselves for practice at a future day,
the knowledge possessed in the more refined branches
of the Art:&mdash;they subsequently illustrated that superior
knowledge at Palenque and Uxmal. In the conclusion
of this section, however, it will be shewn that
the <em>square style</em> of Architecture was essentially Tyrian,
and that it is distinctly visible at Copan and Palenque.
An analogy in regard to antiquity is found from the
stuccoing or plaistering of the walls. This custom in
Art is one of the most ancient on record. Mr. Stephens
would infer from the fact of stuccoing that they had a
modern origin, and actually calls it in one place&mdash;"<em>plaister
of</em> <span class="smcap">Paris</span>!" The custom is mentioned by the first
Lawgiver 1451 <small>YEARS</small> before the Christian Æra!</p>

<p>"And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over
Jordan unto the land which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy <span class="smcap">God</span> giveth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
thee, <em>that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and
plaister them with plaister: and thou shalt</em> <small>WRITE</small> <em>upon
them all the words of this law</em>." [Deut. xxvii. 2, 3.]</p>

<p>Here is not only the proof of the ancient custom of
stuccoing, or hard plaistering;&mdash;but, also, the fact of
<em>Sculpture</em>, or <em>writing upon Stucco</em>,&mdash;of course in its
damp state, and when dry it became, as at Palenque,
"as hard as stone." Again,&mdash;It, also, covered the
interior of the palatial walls of Babylon, and was the
surface upon which was traced the handwriting at
Belshazzar's Feast,&mdash;this was 538 <small>B. C.</small></p>

<p>"In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's
hand, and wrote over against the candlestick,&mdash;upon
the <em>plaister of the wall</em> of the King's palace." [Dan.
v. 5.]</p>

<p>Another analogy is found upon this point of art, as
being used by both the ancient Tyrians and the Aborigines;&mdash;for
the walls of Tyrus were built of large
blocks of stone&mdash;not very hard&mdash;but protected from
the weather by <em>hard white-plaister</em>,&mdash;or <em>stucco</em>;&mdash;the
walls of Palenque seem to be a direct imitation.</p>

<p>It was a custom of the ancient nations to paint their
statues, or figures on the walls, with the primitive
colours,&mdash;but chiefly red or vermilion. In so doing
they believed that they approached the colour of the
Gods,&mdash;and in Rome, from the same feeling, a Conqueror
granted the honour of a triumphal entry to the
Capital, was always painted red, in supposed imitation
of the God of War.</p>

<p>It is recorded in Scripture as being practised by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the Chaldeans, and as a consequence by their associates
the Babylonians.</p>

<p>"For when she saw men pourtrayed on the wall,&mdash;the
images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with <em>vermilion</em>,
&amp;c." [Eze. xxiii. 14.]</p>

<p>It was, also, practised by the Egyptians and Tyrians,&mdash;and
is now discovered in America:&mdash;for Mr. Stephens
states that the sculpture, and even the steps, had
been painted,&mdash;that black and white,&mdash;red, blue, and
yellow are distinctly visible, but that the <em>Red</em> (vermilion)
is predominant. From the number of colours
another analogy is traceable, for of all the ancient
nations that of Tyrus was the most renowned for her
knowledge of colours,&mdash;and when to the "<em>primitive
three</em>," she added by her discovery the celebrated tint,
or Tyrian Dye, her renown was increased, and spread
throughout all the Nations,&mdash;so much so, that they sent
their royal mantles to Tyrus to receive the costly dye&mdash;and
from that fact, regal robes have continued to be
tinted, even to this day, with the gorgeous <em>Purple</em>,&mdash;which,
though originally intended for blood-stained
Kings and warriors,&mdash;succeeding ages have placed
upon even the graceful forms of dove-eyed Queens; (so
strong is custom)&mdash;while the first and Heavenly colour&mdash;blue,&mdash;and
which from Scripture was the tint of
Aaron's Robes of Peace,&mdash;has passed unheeded by,
although commanded by The voice of The King of
Kings.</p>

<p>"And thou shalt make the robe of the Ephod <em>all of
blue</em>." [Ex. xxviii. 31.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The exact tint of the Tyrian Dye is not known, other
than it was <em>purple</em>.&mdash;There are several degrees of
purple,&mdash;light or dark,&mdash;as the <em>blue</em> shall predominate
in its mixture with the <em>Red</em>. The original dye was
derived from a shellfish (purple murex) as before related;&mdash;and
upon the occasion of its being discovered,
the Tyrian thought that his dog had been wounded in
the mouth, for he imagined that his faithful follower
was <em>bleeding</em>:&mdash;here then the tint is arrived at,&mdash;viz.,
that it must have resembled that of <em>blood</em>,&mdash;consequently
it was the <em>light purple</em>, or rather <em>crimson</em> as it
is now termed,&mdash;therefore, the <em>Red</em> predominated over
the Blue.</p>

<p>The Prophet of the Advent defines that in ancient
days (760 <small>B. C.</small>) scarlet, red, and crimson were esteemed
the same,&mdash;they are with us only different in degree,&mdash;but
the two last are proved by Scripture to have been
identical.</p>

<p>"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the
<em>Lord</em>, though your sins be as <small>SCARLET</small>, they shall be
<em>as white as snow</em>: though they be <small>RED LIKE CRIMSON</small>,
they shall be <em>as wool</em>." (<em>i. e.</em> white as snow.) [Isaiah
i. 18.] The latter part of the verse is but a repetition
of the former,&mdash;a favourite style in Holy-Writ, to enforce
the precepts upon the mind of the reader or hearer.</p>

<p>Now the more ancient of the Ruins in Mexican America,
are stained or painted <em>Red</em>:&mdash;the Traveller, however,
does not express the degree of Red,&mdash;light or
dark,&mdash;or whether it contained any other colour with
it;&mdash;it is enough that Red is distinctly stated:&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
may not the Aborigines have dyed their sculpture in
remembrance of their past celebrity at Tyrus? If at
Copan (their first city) they had mixed <em>Blue</em> with
<em>Red</em> to produce the <em>blood-purple</em>, the lapse of centuries
would have extracted the minor colour&mdash;blue,&mdash;(minor
from its proportion in mixture),&mdash;and have left the
major colour,&mdash;Red,&mdash;entire,&mdash;as it now appears upon
the Idols, Altars, and steps of these Egypto-Tyrian monuments
in Ancient America. Again; the knowledge
of colours by the Tyrians, (and those in which they
excelled)&mdash;is distinctly stated in the Bible. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>
in sending to <span class="smcap">Hiram</span>, King of Tyrus (1015 <small>B. C.</small>) for
Artists to build and adorn the Temple of Jerusalem,&mdash;says&mdash;</p>

<p>"Send me now, therefore, a man cunning <em>to work</em>
in gold and in silver, and in brass and in iron,&mdash;and in
<em>purple</em>, and <em>crimson</em>, and <em>blue</em>, &amp;c." [2 Chronicles
ii. 7.] "Blue" is directly expressed, and by its mixture
with "Crimson" (<em>i. e.</em> Red.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</i> Isaiah i. 18.)
in certain proportions would produce "Purple."&mdash;Now
in Mexican America we have seen, that Blue and Red
(and perhaps originally a Purple), are found, and used
by the Aborigines to adorn their first Temple at Copan,
as Solomon did his Temple at Jerusalem,&mdash;<em>through
the skill and knowledge of the</em> <span class="smcap">Tyrians</span>!&mdash;who without
doubt practised their art in colours upon their own
Temples at Tyrus,&mdash;and which Solomon, in compliment
to Hiram (with whom he was in the strictest
bonds of amity), was willing to, and did, imitate, in the
Capital of Israel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Had the Tyrians possessed <em>no knowledge</em> of Colours,
the discovery of them upon the Mexican Ruins would
have been useless in reference to any analogy, and injurious
against identity;&mdash;but, the Tyrians having the
knowledge of the three primitives, and of a fourth colour,
and had they not been discovered at Copan or Palenque,
then the <em>want</em> of a similitude would be evident and
material;&mdash;but, as both People,&mdash;the Tyrians and the
Aborigines,&mdash;possessed the same knowledge, and practice
of colouring their Temples,&mdash;the Analogy is not
only apparent, but absolute.</p>

<p>It will be remembered by the reader, that in the
Sepulchral Chamber at Copan, an Engraved Gem was
found,&mdash;"<em>a small death's-head</em> (skull) <small>CARVED</small> <em>in fine
green stone</em>." The antiquity of this style of engraving
has been shewn in alluding to Aaron's "breastplate of
judgment,"&mdash;but, we will now prove that another <em>Tyrian</em>
analogy is found in the carved Gem of Copan,&mdash;That
the <em>Tyrians</em> were engravers of Gem-stones is established
upon the authority of Scriptural history,&mdash;and
from that Sacred Volume it is, also, proved, that the
<em>Tyrians</em> were the builders of Solomon's Temple.&mdash;This
will be enlarged upon in the history of Tyrus.&mdash;Solomon
wrote to Hiram for a superior artist, in addition
to the general workmen, "to work in gold, and
in silver, &amp;c.&mdash;<em>and that can skill to grave</em>,"&mdash;the Hebrew
text is, "to grave gravings,"&mdash;or in modern phrase&mdash;to
<em>engrave</em>,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> cut, or carve metal or stones. The
King of Tyrus answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now I have sent a cunning (<em>i. e.</em> skilful) man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
[of the same name as the King, <em>i. e.</em> Hiram] * * *
"skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron,
<em>in stone</em>;&mdash;also, <em>to grave any manner of graving</em>." [2
Chron. ii. 13, 14.] That Solomon availed himself of
the skill of this Artist in Gem-engraving is proved by
the following verse:</p>

<p>"And he garnished the house [<em>i. e.</em> Temple] with
<em>precious stones</em> for beauty." [<em>i. e.</em> of workmanship.]
[2 Chron. iii. 6.]</p>

<p>We shall conclude this Section with an analogy that
may appear strange to the general reader, but it is no less
true than original, and from which, Identity is apparent.</p>

<p>The Wisdom of Solomon (and inferentially his people
also) did not embrace the practical Sciences of Architecture,
Sculpture, or Navigation. He was compelled
to apply for all these to the <em>Tyrian</em> Monarch. Solomon's
wisdom was of the philosophy of <em>Nature</em>, and
not <em>in the defined Arts or Sciences</em>.&mdash;This is shewn in
the first Book of Kings [ch. iv. 32, 33.]</p>

<p>"And he (Solomon) spake three thousand <em>Proverbs</em>,
and his <em>Songs</em> were a thousand and five. And he spake
of <em>trees</em>,&mdash;from the <em>cedar tree</em> that is in Lebanon, even
unto the <em>hyssop</em> that springeth out of the wall: he spake
also, of <em>beasts</em>,&mdash;and of <em>fowl</em>,&mdash;and of <em>creeping things</em>,&mdash;and
of <em>fishes</em>." Five centuries before Solomon,&mdash;the
Hebrew artists,&mdash;Bezaleel and Aholiab,&mdash;were
called by The <span class="smcap">Almighty</span>, and presented to Moses for a
special purpose. [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</i> Exodus xxxv. 30&mdash;35.]</p>

<p>The <em>Tyrians</em> were the Architects and Sculptors of
the Temple of Solomon, and in the description of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Edifice it will be found that the <em>square</em>,&mdash;or four-sided,&mdash;columns
and bases prevailed, to the exclusion of
the circular,&mdash;even the <em>door-posts of the Temple</em> were
<em>square</em>:&mdash;the same are seen at Palenque!</p>

<p>"So also made he for the door of the Temple posts
of olive trees,&mdash;<em>a fourth part</em> of the wall,"&mdash;[1 Kings
vi. 33]&mdash;defined to be&mdash;"four-square."</p>

<p>The two brazen Pillars of the Porch of the Temple
<em>were square</em>,&mdash;and <em>about five feet six inches on each
side</em>,&mdash;(what are the Pillars at Copan?)&mdash;and the capitals
covered with carved "nets of checker work" and
"wreaths of chain-work,"&mdash;upon these were suspended
"two rows of pomegranates."</p>

<p>The celebrated "bases" were distinctly square,&mdash;and
about <em>seven feet on each side</em>.</p>

<p>"And he (the Tyrian Artist) made ten bases of
brass,&mdash;<em>four</em> cubits (21 inches and a fraction each cubit,
Scripture measure,) was the <em>length</em> of one base, and
<em>four</em> cubits the <em>breadth</em> thereof" [this is a perfect
square]. "And there were four undersetters <em>to the four
corners of one base</em>,"&mdash;"And also upon the mouth of
it (the laver) were <em>gravings</em> with their <em>borders, four-square,
not round</em>."&mdash;"And after this manner he made
the ten bases [<em>i. e.</em> square columns]: all of them had
one casting [Hebrew: "<em>fashioning</em>"], one measure and
one size." [1 Kings, ch. vii.]</p>

<p>Now the square style of Architecture in Solomon's
Temple may distinctly be claimed as <em>Tyrian</em> Architecture&mdash;for
the Tyrians were the Architects, Sculptors,
and Builders, directed by Hiram the Artist,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
it is self-evident, since they were so, that they followed
that style generally adopted in their own country;&mdash;here
then is a direct proof of the <em>Tyrian</em> Architecture
being in Ancient America,&mdash;for the reader will instantly
recognise that the Square-columns form the "door-posts"
also at Palenque,&mdash;and that the Idol-Obelisks at
Copan are "four-square, not round" and covered with
"gravings"&mdash;(<em>i. e.</em> Sculptures). The superficial measure
of the "square piers,"&mdash;or columns at Palenque,
does not vary in a great degree from the square Porch-columns
and bases at Jerusalem,&mdash;while the Hebrew
"pomegranates" at the latter Capital, were varied,&mdash;yet
the florid style of Tyrian Sculpture imitated in the
"compositions of leaves and flowers" at Uxmal.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to prove that the <em>measurement</em>
of the Temple on Mount Moriah, and that at Palenque,
are identical, in order to establish the analogy now
under consideration, because local applications of their
respective dimensions would create essential variations.
In the previous reign (that of David) King Hiram
sent his Tyrian Architects to Jerusalem, and built a
Palace for the Monarch of Israel,&mdash;and in the reign of
Solomon, (who resolved to erect the Temple) the same
King of Tyrus was applied to for artists to build the
great Mansion of Religion,&mdash;Solomon did not command
<em>how it should be built,&mdash;or in what order or style of
Architecture</em>;&mdash;that he left to the Tyrians, who were
practical artists,&mdash;<small>THEY</small> <em>gave</em> <small>HIM</small> <em>the design</em>, upon his
expressing to the Chief Architect the "wants" of the
edifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now these are the things wherein Solomon was
<em>instructed</em> for the building of the house of <span class="smcap">God</span>," &amp;c.
[2 Chron. iii. 3.]</p>

<p>We have expressed in the previous pages, that no
Tyrian <em>Ruins</em> in Asia or Africa are found, whereby
the style of that Nation's Architecture could be identified,&mdash;none
exist in Sidon, Tyrus, or Carthage;&mdash;but,
the never-decaying Volume of Religion, contains a
living picture of Tyrian art and style at Jerusalem, that
never can be in Ruins:&mdash;though the identifying marbles
of Ph&oelig;nician architecture,&mdash;like the first stone-tablets
of the Decalogue,&mdash;are broken and lost "beneath the
Mount" of Time,&mdash;yet upon the page of Holy-Writ do
they both appear as new,&mdash;as perfect,&mdash;as when first
erected by Tyrians for the Son of David,&mdash;or traced by
the finger of <span class="smcap">God</span> for the instruction, and civilization
of mankind!</p>

<p>The Temple of Solomon, upon the authority of the
Bible, was of Tyrian Architecture, (for the Israelites,
we repeat it, had no knowledge of the Arts at that time,)
built and adorned by the Tyrians,&mdash;the same Architecture
is found in the Ruins of Ancient America, and
consequently Tyrian,&mdash;while the substructure being a
portion of a Pyramid, justly authorizes (we submit)
the new term of Egypto-Tyrian.</p>

<p>We cannot dismiss this interesting discovery of an
analogy between the Architecture of the Temples of

two latter to be Tyrian,&mdash;without the remark,&mdash;that if
no other similitude could be found in this volume in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
order to identify the Mexican Aborigines as Tyrians,
we think that the analogy of the Temples alone, would
satisfy the reader upon that point; as also, that this
History has not been written without that due regard
to testimony, and undeniable evidence, demanded by
the importance of the subject;&mdash;and which, being novel
and surprising, requires more than usual proof to convince
the mind, that it is analyzing a proposition of
truth, and not one of sophistry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having stopped the Press to insert these remarks upon Mr. Stephens's
<em>second</em> visit to Yucatan, we cannot refrain from offering a few
observations upon a paragraph by one of the most learned and accomplished
Reviewers of the present day,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;and one who has the distinguished
honour of having first brought the Ruins of Ancient America
to the general notice of Europe, through the medium of his talented
periodical. In reviewing<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Mr. Stephens's volumes upon "Incidents
of Travel in Yucatan," (2d Visit,)&mdash;the Editor writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The difference in declension between Central and North America
offers a problem worthy of philosophical consideration. In the former
case, the Mexican Indian, notwithstanding massacres of merciless
atrocity, has been allowed to remain, albeit scattered on the soil of
his ancestors, and <em>to enter into a combination</em> (<em>i. e.</em> Marriage) whence
another race of mankind has sprung: in the latter [the Northern]
the white invader (Anglo-Saxon) has chased him from his native
possessions and driven him to limits, <em>where utter extermination seems
to be his doom</em>. The comparison could hardly be made without indicating
a conclusion highly favourable to the iron-clad Spaniards of
what we choose to call an ignorant and a barbarous age (1520), and
against the more modern offspring (1620) of our country and enlightened
times. <em>Though the thirst of gold was the same in both
instances</em>, it does appear, and it is melancholy to reflect upon it, that
something of nobler impulses belonged to the elder (or Spanish)
æra."</p>

<p>We have quoted the entire paragraph to which attention is desired,
and shall now review the several parts,&mdash;and trust in a few remarks
to remove the unintentional stain upon the Anglo-Saxon race, which
the above extract has placed upon them:&mdash;as also, affording an additional
opportunity of supporting our previous assertions, that the
Aborigines were <em>two</em> distinct People.</p>

<p>"The difference in declension [<em>i. e.</em> of the existing Aboriginal population]
between Central and North America offers a problem worthy
of philosophical consideration." We had already solved this problem
in the first pages of this volume, before the above was brought to our
observation. The solution is founded upon historic truth,&mdash;viz., that
the Aborigines of the <em>North</em> will not <em>intermarry</em>, or cohabit, with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
race but their own,&mdash;they have a Religious abhorrence even at the
supposition of such a sacrilege,&mdash;for in their minds it is one. This
principle of the House of Israel is even followed in European Society
by the Jewish family,&mdash;and that after ages of intercourse with the
Christian. It seems impossible to eradicate the prejudice with the
Aborigines of the North,&mdash;and this has been one of the greatest barriers
to the propagation of the Christian Religion among them. As
a most convincing proof of the above, we offer an historic fact not
generally known even in America, and certainly not in Europe,&mdash;but
it is given upon the authority of the late President of the United
States,&mdash;General Harrison,&mdash;and it is, therefore, unimpeachable. In
writing the forthcoming Life and History of that distinguished Patriot,
it came under our observation during the required researches,&mdash;and
is found in a document of his as late in date as 1838,&mdash;viz., At the
commencement of the American Revolution in 1775,&mdash;the government
of Great Britain (through the influence of her traders), engaged all
the North-western Aborigines in her cause, for the purpose of laying
waste the frontiers. The Continental Congress, most anxious to destroy
this junction and impending calamity,&mdash;sent delegates to convince
them that they were not a party to the quarrel, and therefore
should be neutral. The application met with no success, for the Aborigines
viewed the Colonists as their enemies and invaders,&mdash;because
they were the actual possessors and occupiers of the land and homes of
their ancestors. The Congress knowing that from the time of the
Pilgrims landing at Plymouth, (1620) the Aborigines would never associate
as a community with the Anglo-Saxon race&mdash;by <em>the great
family bond of Intermarriage</em>;&mdash;the Congress then had recourse to
the following novel proposition,&mdash;and it was actually embodied in a
treaty concluded with the Delaware Tribes in 1778,&mdash;viz., <em>That the
Aborigines of the North</em>, by remaining neutral in the War,&mdash;<em>should
be consolidated into a State by themselves</em>, and upon the achievement
of National Independence, <em>should be incorporated into the Republic of
the United States</em>! The following are President Harrison's words,&mdash;viz.,
"Nothing can shew the anxiety of Congress to effect this object
in stronger colours, than the agreement entered into with the Delaware
Tribes, at a treaty concluded at Pittsburgh in 1778. By an
article in that Treaty, <em>the United-States proposed</em> that a State should
be formed, to be composed of the Delawares and the other Tribes of
the North,&mdash;and contracted to admit them, when so formed,&mdash;as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of the members of the Union."&mdash;[Historical Discourse, Ohio, 1838.]
The above fact of History certainly proves the anxiety of the Congress,
not only to avoid their enmity, but to provide at a future day
<em>for their continuance as a People</em>, and not their "extermination."
The same policy of the United-States has now placed all the Tribes
on the West of the Mississippi,&mdash;(for they would form no community
founded upon intermarriage), and there to be protected by the Government
of the United-States against all invaders. In vain shall we
search the Spanish Annals for an instance (in their Mexican Conquests,)
of humanity like these acts of American commiseration
and Christian policy.</p>

<p>In the second sentence of the paragraph quoted from the Literary
Gazette, the Editor has given the identical cause why the Mexican
Aborigines are still found upon their lands,&mdash;not as owners, but
as Slaves,&mdash;viz., <em>that they did intermarry</em>&mdash;("enter into a combination,"
&amp;c.)&mdash;thence the <em>two</em> races are apparent upon
the strongest ground of argument,&mdash;viz., Religious principles,&mdash;and
which, with all Aborigines are the guides to their actions. Therefore,
the Editor by his remarks upon the Mexican race, actually solved,
though unconsciously, the problem proposed in his first sentence.
In forming a "comparison" between the Spanish invasion by Cortez,
in 1520, and the landing of the Pilgrim-Fathers in 1620, any writer
must fail,&mdash;for without <em>similitude</em> there can be <em>no comparison</em>;&mdash;<em>contrast</em>
is the word, and never in the history of nations was there a
greater contrast than between the Spanish and Anglo-Saxon races, in
their <em>motive</em> in landing in Mexico and in New-England: but the
Editor has written "<em>Though the thirst of</em> <span class="smcap">Gold</span> <em>was the same in</em>
<small>BOTH</small> <em>instances</em>, it does appear, and it is melancholy to reflect upon it,
<em>that something of nobler impulses belonged to the elder</em> (or Spanish)
<em>æra</em>!" Cortez and Pizarro, and their bands of pirates, were alone
possessed with an unquenchable "thirst of gold,"&mdash;it was "the god
of their idolatry,"&mdash;even the humane Columbus could only hold his
power with the Spanish Government by sending home the precious
metal,&mdash;and when it failed, so declined his influence; and it at last
compelled him to have recourse to making Slaves of the natives of
Hispaniola,&mdash;and each had allotted to him a task of bringing a small
bell full of gold from the mountains, and if they failed, stripes were
their punishment; and of all the natives, not one acre of land was purchased,
or even attempted. The Spaniards found, <em>as we will prove</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
branches of Christianity!&mdash;and yet with the Crucifix in one hand, and
the brand or dagger in their other,&mdash;they sacrificed <em>eleven millions</em> of
human beings to their unhallowed invasions, lust, and thirst for gold:&mdash;but
were the <em>English</em> so possessed when in the depth of dreary winter
they braved the dangers of the broad Atlantic?&mdash;What drove that
band of Pilgrim-Fathers forth to seek an unknown wilderness for a
home and shelter? Was it gold?&mdash;would they have dealt with
money-changers in the Temple?&mdash;No!&mdash;One thought alone throbbed
within their hearts,&mdash;viz., To worship their <span class="smcap">God</span> and <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>
according to the solemn dictates of their conscience! They
were Englishmen, and the first promulgators of Religious and
Civil freedom in the Western Hemisphere.&mdash;Upon their landing
did they enslave the Natives for gold-finders?&mdash;No!&mdash;They
offered the hand of amity,&mdash;and in it <em>they gave gold</em> for acres,
and obtained the land by fair and honourable purchase. Entering
upon their pilgrimage upon the principle only of Religious
freedom,&mdash;the Northern-native has been ever permitted to enjoy the
same; and not a record of that land will prove, that the English ever
sacrificed a human being upon the ground of Religious belief or disbelief.
It is the very <em>principle of the Contrast</em> between the Spanish
conquest and the English landing on the Western Continent, that has
made the essential difference, even to this day, in the stability of the
Governments of the two European races, Spanish and Anglo-Saxon.
The former was based upon injustice, lust, and avarice,&mdash;thence can be
traced the eventual downfall of the Spanish principles in South America;
but the latter was Freedom-founded, and based upon laws, virtue,
equity,&mdash;and thence, as a consequence, the Anglo-Saxon family still
remain firm and secure. Their House being built upon a Rock, and
daring,&mdash;like the Parent-Country,&mdash;the wild elements of tyranny
even to approach the foundation, they fear no "comparison" with a
blood-stained Mansion erected upon the Sands; and which the waves
of Time have so far swept from view, that even the false proportions
would have been lost, had not History placed them in her archives as
a warning to posterity! Apology, we trust, is not required for this
almost digressive note;&mdash;the just defence of the character of England
and the United-States has been our only motive;&mdash;and that being
our <em>rule of action</em> through life, either in public or private, we could
not avoid it. G. J.</p></blockquote>

<h3>SECTION IV.</h3>


<h4>
SEPULCHRAL ANALOGIES.</h4>

<p class="center">
MUMMIES OF EGYPT, TENERIFFE, AND PERU, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>In the previous Sections of this important chapter,
the customs and analogies of the <em>living</em> have been reviewed
and compared,&mdash;those now to be investigated
have relation to the <em>dead</em>.</p>

<p>In all countries the peculiar customs observed at the
interment of the dead, have a distinct, and a National
character:&mdash;those customs proclaim the people of a
nation with as much certainty, as the Ruins of the
Parthenon speak of Athens and the Athenians.</p>

<p>At the present day "the <em>ashes</em> of the dead" is a
strong, and a poetic phrase, and used even by Christian
writers,&mdash;whereas it is strictly heathen in its application:&mdash;"<em>dust
to dust</em>" is essentially Christian, and
the sentence belongs to, and identifies the modern European
family;&mdash;while,&mdash;"<em>ashes</em> of the dead,"&mdash;indicating
thereby, <em>fire</em> as the consuming quality,&mdash;points
to India, Rome, and many ancient Nations as authors
of the pyro-ceremony.</p>

<p>Pompey's decapitated body, though thrown upon the
shore of Egypt, was consumed to "ashes" by the humble
but honest follower of Cæsar's Master, that the sepulchral
custom of ancient <em>Italy</em> should be accomplished
upon, and by, a Son of Rome. The self-immolation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the widow upon the funeral pyre of her departed husband,
points to the nation following that inhuman custom
to be Hindoostan;&mdash;while the embalmed Mummies
with their Sarcophagi, direct the antiquarian mind to
Egypt, with as much certainty, as her "starry-pointing
Pyramids," or her Sphinx-guarded Temples. Upon this
accredited conclusion of the identity of nations, from
the manner of disposing of their dead, will be claimed
authority to establish a strong argument and analogy in
support of the present subject,&mdash;and founded upon the
<em>fac-simile</em> resemblance between the ancient Mummies
of the Canary Islands, and those in Mexican America.</p>

<p>The general reader may not be aware that Mummies
have been found in any other nation than Egypt;&mdash;they
have, however, been discovered (but without the Sarcophagi)
at <em>Arico</em>, in the Island of Teneriffe, and at
<em>Arica</em> in Peru,&mdash;a similitude is discernible even in the
local name given to the districts where the Mummy-pits
are found. An analogy is at once perceptible in analyzing
the ancient word <em>Guanches</em> (the Aborigines of
Teneriffe),&mdash;it is derived from <em>Guan</em>,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> Man,&mdash;consequently
in his natural and uncontrolled state,&mdash;therefore
Freemen,&mdash;this fact is sanctioned <em>by their
escape from thraldom</em> or <span class="smcap">Slavery</span>, when they first arrived
on the Island, as will be shewn in the Second
Book of this Volume. Again, in Ancient America, the
places where Mummies are found are called <em>Guacas</em>,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>
the abode of Man in his decayed state. The
Reader will instantly perceive that in the construction
of the word, as used in both localities, there is a direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
similitude. The first land also rediscovered by Columbus
in the Western Hemisphere, was called by the natives&mdash;<em>Guanahani</em>,&mdash;the
Genoese named it St. Salvador.</p>

<p>The word "Teneriffe," in the original language of
the ancient inhabitants,&mdash;the Guanches,&mdash;signifies&mdash;White-Mountain,&mdash;(<em>Thanar</em>&mdash;mountain,&mdash;and
<em>Iffe</em>&mdash;white),&mdash;from
the celebrated Peak being (from its altitude)
always covered with snow.</p>

<p>In the singular burial-cavern of the Capuchin
Friars near Palermo, there are over 2000 dead bodies,&mdash;they
have erroneously been called "Mummies;"&mdash;for
the bodies are not in any manner embalmed, but
dried by a slow fire, (or furnace-oven) and then arranged
in groups around the subterranean galleries.</p>

<p>The word "mummy" was originally applied to a
drug so called; and it was probably used by the
Egyptians as one of their ingredients in embalming&mdash;or
preserving&mdash;the dead. The Bard of Avon evidently
so understood it,&mdash;viz., that it was a drug possessing a
<em>preserving</em> quality. Othello's description of his "first
gift" to Desdemona will explain.&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>It may appear strange, at the first glance, that there
should be any connexion between the Mummies of
Teneriffe and those of Peru, towards establishing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the Mexican Aborigines were originally Tyrians:&mdash;but
there is a connexion, and as certain, as that a chain of
three links owes its utility to the connecting power of
the central one. Teneriffe forms that central link between
Tyrus and the Western Continent.</p>

<p>The natural and apparent question then is,&mdash;Were
the Guanches (ancient Canarians) originally from the
Tyrian family?&mdash;this we distinctly answer in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>Mr. Pettigrew, in his valuable "History of Egyptian
Mummies," has the following remark upon those discovered
at Teneriffe.</p>

<p>"That the inhabitants of the Canary Islands should
have adopted <em>a practice of embalming in some measure
similar to that of the Egyptian is rather singular</em>,&mdash;seeing
they were separated from each other by <em>the
entire breadth of Northern Africa</em>." [p. 237.]</p>

<p>Now the above author assumes, as a necessity,&mdash;that
the ancient Guanches (Canarians) must have emigrated
by <em>land</em>,&mdash;otherwise the sentence "entire
breadth of Northern Africa" is uselessly brought forward
to express the barrier between the Islands and
Egypt. The emigration by land cannot be sustained,
but is absolutely rejected, from the fact, that the
Guanches must have had navigable means to have
reached the chief Islands even <em>after</em> they had arrived
upon the Shores of the Continent,&mdash;which are nearly
150 miles from Teneriffe. This fact then points to a nation
having acquaintance with Egypt, and the means
of Navigation,&mdash;and also of one "advanced in civilization,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
for such were the now extinct nation of the
Guanches, as related by Spanish historians. Truth
seems at once to point to the Tyrians as the Aborigines
of those Islands.</p>

<p>Mr. Pettigrew probably forgot that Herodotus has
recorded the celebrated Egypto-Tyrian expedition
around the Continent of Africa, and which occurred
609&mdash;606 years before Christ. It is apparent that the
<em>Fortunatæ Insulæ</em>,&mdash;as the Canary Islands were called
by the Ancients,&mdash;were discovered during the three
years voyage related by the Greek historian, for they
were known to the Tyrians centuries before the Christian
Æra. This celebrated expedition, and the proofs
of its being accomplished, will be investigated and
established in the pages devoted to the History of
Tyrus.</p>

<p>After the direful event which drove the Tyrians
for ever from the Mediterranean (which will be elucidated
hereafter), we believe that their first resting-place
was among the Canary Islands,&mdash;and as the Peak of
Teneriffe arose as a welcome beacon,&mdash;that Island became
to them the chief place of temporary residence
after their fortunate escape. It appears almost evident
that the group was then named by the Tyrians,&mdash;for as
<em>the Fortunate Isles</em> they are known in ancient geography.
The name seems to allude to some "foregone
conclusion," a peculiarly happy circumstance (<em>i. e.</em>
escape from foe or wreck) being connected with the
naming.</p>

<p>That the Aborigines of these Islands, and those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Ancient America were the same, will be admitted
from the Mummies discovered in the two Countries.
They are identical with each other, and they are not
Egyptian,&mdash;for they lack the stone Sarcophagi, the
hieroglyphics and the mummy Cloths. The mummies
of Peru and Teneriffe are bound in skins of animals,&mdash;(a
custom no where else <em>found</em>, although it is <em>recorded</em>
of the Scythians)&mdash;those of the former in the skin of
the lama,&mdash;those of the latter in the goat-skin, an
animal with which the Island abounded, and with the
skins of which the original inhabitants clothed themselves.
The Mummies of both Countries are also,
bound within the skins by leather thongs and straps,
made from the hides of the respective animals. Such
facts cannot be accidental,&mdash;they must be identical.</p>

<p>The manner described above, may have been the
custom throughout all Mexican America;&mdash;that they
are only discovered at Arica in <em>Peru</em>, may arise from
natural causes,&mdash;viz., at Arica the rain never falls (as in
Egypt) and the soil is calcareous,&mdash;and the dryness of
the atmosphere, with the saline qualities of the earth,
produce natural embalming; thus preserving the body
for ages from decomposition,&mdash;while in other portions
of the Continent, from the moisture, and the absence
of the preserving qualities, the bodies would gradually
decay, and return and mingle with the undistinguishing
dust of centuries. Many analogies are found to the
Tyrians, in the details and decorations of the Peruvian
Mummies,&mdash;both of the rich and the poor. Those of
the poor are invariably found resting upon beds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
<em>broken fish-shells</em>;&mdash;these beds are supposed to be placed
there for "religious motives." May not the purple
murex (<em>i. e.</em> dye shellfish) of Tyrus (as on the Altar
of Copan) be here alluded to by this religious custom?
In the same Mummy-pits (and they extend over a mile)
are found various <em>models of boats</em>, <em>lines</em>, <em>and fish-hooks</em>;
these are buried with the Mummies, and they are
evident witnesses of the occupation,&mdash;or the "religious
motives" of the departed. Is not Tyrus here also?&mdash;her
fisheries were her National emblems. And that
this custom (whereby the means of sustenance were
obtained) was practised in South America by the Aborigines,
is distinctly stated by Dr. Robertson, upon the
authority of Berrere. The statement, also, shews that
the distinction between those of the North and South,
or Mexican America is apparent,&mdash;those of the former
depended upon hunting for their sustenance,&mdash;those of
the latter,&mdash;or the Tyrian descendants,&mdash;as did their
ancestors, upon their fisheries. Robertson says&mdash;"In
this part of the globe (<em>i. e.</em> South America) hunting
seems <em>not</em> to have been the first employment of men,
or the first effort of their invention and labour to obtain
food. They were <em>fishers</em> before they became hunters."
[Vol. v., Book iv., p. 318.]</p>

<p>The <em>boat-model</em> is directly emblematical of a Religious
custom of Tyrus,&mdash;copied from the Egyptian,&mdash;viz.,
the belief that the <em>Soul</em> had to pass through various
stages and translations, before it reached its final
destination or happiness. To accomplish this, the <em>body</em>
was to pass over a River,&mdash;in a sacred-barge or boat:&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the helmsman was called by the Egyptians in their
own language,&mdash;<em>Charon</em>. The Classic reader will instantly
trace the mythological fable of Greece, concerning
the Ferryman of the River Styx,&mdash;probably
introduced into Grecian Thebes by the Tyrian
Cadmus.</p>

<p>The Mummies of the rich discovered in Peru, are
invariably wrapped in cloth, <em>crimson</em> (purple) <em>coloured</em>;&mdash;here
then is the National colour of Tyrus, (derived
from the shellfish) and which made that country so
renowned. The <em>colour itself</em> is found enveloping the
bodies of the rich,&mdash;while the useless and "broken
shells" are found beneath the Mummies of the poor,&mdash;<em>the
same National tribute to both</em>,&mdash;though in degree,
according to the <em>wealth</em> of the deceased;&mdash;for the
Tyrians, like the Egyptians, would not admit of any
distinction in the grave, as to rank or title;&mdash;but,
believed that in the great Republic of Death, all were
equal,&mdash;and,&mdash;as in the Kingdom of Kingdoms,&mdash;that
good deeds alone constituted the true distinctions.</p>

<p>In a notice of the Ancient Mummies of Teneriffe,
the Baron Humboldt states, that they <em>differ from the
Egyptians</em> in physiognomy, and that the ornaments
resemble those used in Mexican America! Now when
the illustrious Traveller wrote those facts (as shewn
in the following quotation), there was no Theory in his
mind in reference to the Tyrians,&mdash;yet his remarks
will support this present History, and they are too
important, as to undeniable authority, to be passed by
indifferently by the reader. Baron Humboldt says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"On examining carefully the physiognomy of the
<em>ancient Canarians</em>, able anatomists have recognised
in the cheek-bones, and the lower jaw, perceptible <em>differences</em>
from the Egyptian Mummies. The corpses
are often decorated with small laces [necklaces] to
which are hung little <em>disks</em> of baked earth [clay] that
seemed to have served as numerical [Religious?] Signs;
and <em>resemble the quippoes of the Peruvians and Mexicans</em>!"
[Per. Nar., p. 278.]</p>

<p>Here then upon the high authority of Humboldt,
is an analogy traced between the ornaments of the
Mummies of the Guanches (Tyrians) and the ancient
inhabitants of Mexican America.</p>

<p>Upon every consideration of the subject the Mummies
discovered at Teneriffe and in Peru are identical;&mdash;the
same kind are not found in any other parts of the
world,&mdash;and Teneriffe (as chief of the Fortunate Isles)
was known, visited, and inhabited by the Tyrians.</p>


<h3>SECTION V.</h3>

<h4>SUMMARY OF ANALOGIES BETWEEN THE ANCIENT TYRIANS AND
MEXICAN ABORIGINES.</h4>

<p>To prove that the Mexican Aborigines were originally
from the Tyrians, we have established the following
powerful Analogies, as being practised, found,
or in tradition among the People of both Nations, and
they are the only two countries where the same similitudes
can be found;&mdash;we will not say in a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
instance, but <em>collectively</em>,&mdash;and in that way only should
they be viewed by the reader. The summary is as
follows: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>Religious Idolatry:&mdash;the worship of, and sacrifice of
human lives to the God of War; the worship of Saturn,
and consequent Infanticide to propitiate the remorseless
deity; the long Cross (and others) of the Goddess Astart&#275;,
in the Sculpture;&mdash;the sacrifice to Hygeia by <em>optional</em>
Circumcision;&mdash;the chief worship to Apollo,&mdash;or
the Sun;&mdash;the gorgeous Temples erected to his glory;&mdash;human
sacrifice upon the dedication of the Temples;&mdash;and
the Sacred Fire,&mdash;guarded by the Virgins of
the Sun. The comparative Mummies of the Tyrian
Isles and Peru; the traditional story concerning Swans;
the Tortoise and Serpent in Sculpture; the dye-shell,
or purple murex;&mdash;Navigation with its attendant
Maps and Charts;&mdash;the Aborigines coming from "the
East," and by Navigation;&mdash;their landing,&mdash;or "touching
at Florida," and "before the Christian Æra,"&mdash;then
the discovery of the wreck of a Tyrian galley. The
knowledge of Painting, and the general application of
Colours; and Gem engraving. As the Sculpture contains
only hieroglyphics, and not one cipher or letter,
consequently the spoken language of Ph&oelig;nicia is not
found,&mdash;<em>nor is there any other language discovered</em>,&mdash;and
for a proof of its antiquity, the Tyrian-Temple
Sculpture should be <em>only</em> hieroglyphical. The political
character in the formation of Monarchies and Republics,
as shewn at Tyrus and Carthage, Mexico and
Toltecas:&mdash;Military character, and knowledge of defensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
locality, with analogous Architecture in the
sea and river-walls of Tyrus and Copan. The <em>last
event</em> in the history of Tyrus, sculptured upon the
Chief Altar of the most ancient Ruin (Copan); and
from the character of that event, it would naturally
become the <em>first subject</em> of record in the country to
which they had emigrated,&mdash;every detail of that Altar
is essentially Tyrian. <em>Painted</em> sculpture, and the stuccoing
of the walls of Tyrus and Palenque. The
Architecture, as to its square-columned style, identified
as Tyrian, and proved to be analogous from the
Temples of Jerusalem and Palenque: and from the
square Pillars of Copan;&mdash;while the pyramidal base
produced the compound term,&mdash;Egypto-Tyrian.</p>

<p>These absolute analogies have been traced from
Holy-Writ, (and from that source others are to follow)
Histories, and Traditions,&mdash;from Sculpture, Coins, and
Architecture, and the entire range of the Arts;&mdash;<em>Earth</em>
and <em>Ocean</em> have rendered their records, to establish
that the same knowledge and customs were possessed
by both Nations,&mdash;nor will the proof of identity stop
there;&mdash;their mutual knowledge was also found in
that science where <em>Heaven</em> itself was, and is, the illuminated
map of study,&mdash;where the Stars, as letters of
fire, form the language of the Skies,&mdash;<span class="smcap">God Himself</span>
being the Alpha and the Omega!</p>

<p>The sublime Science of <span class="smcap">Astronomy</span> claims both
Tyrus and Tyrian-America for her children and pupils,&mdash;the
latter viewed, and solved the problem of the
annual course of the glorious Sun (the chief worship),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with as much accuracy (save a diurnal fraction) as
the later, and more accomplished scholars and disciples,&mdash;Italy,
Germany, and England.</p>

<p>In reference to historical evidence, and testimony,
founded upon analogies and coincidences, the acute
observer, Dr. Paley, says&mdash;</p>

<p>"The undesignedness of coincidences is to be gathered
from their latency, their minuteness, their obliquity:&mdash;the
suitableness of the circumstances in which
they consist to the places in which those circumstances
occur, and the circuitous references by which they are
traced out, demonstrate that they have not been produced
by meditation or by fraudulent contrivance; but
coincidences from which these causes are excluded,
and which are too close and numerous to be accounted
for by accidental concurrence of fiction,&mdash;must necessarily
have Truth for their foundation."</p>

<p>As this History of Ancient America is founded upon
the great principle of the Baconian philosophy,&mdash;viz., Inductive
reasoning,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> <em>facts</em>, accumulated to prove a
theory;&mdash;it therefore, follows, that the novel secrets of
this History, are <em>discoveries</em>, not inventions,&mdash;and
they essentially are upheld, and supported, by the
records of The Bible.</p>

<p>We submit to the opinion even of a sceptical reader,
whether he does not, with the foregone proofs, believe our
historical proposition,&mdash;viz., <em>That Tyrians were the
first inhabitants of Ancient America, and the original
builders of the now Ruined Cities and Temples</em>?&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
should he believe, or even waver, the subsequent Book
of this Volume (exemplifying the <em>cause</em> and <em>time</em>) will
confirm his thought, or remove his doubt. Following
our Scriptural motto, and instruction, we shall still
obey that voice of advice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For enquire, I pray thee, <em>of the former Age</em>,&mdash;and
prepare thyself to the search of <em>their Fathers</em>; shall not
they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of
their heart?" [Book of Job, viii. 8 and 10.]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center">
THE INOVATIONS UPON THE CUSTOMS OF THE TYRIANS<br />
IN AMERICA EXPLAINED.<br />
</p>


<p>A small space will be sufficient for this explanation.
Any innovation upon a National custom, demonstrates
an anterior existence of that custom; and that the innovation,
as a necessity, must follow, or be posterior in
date to the custom innovated upon.</p>

<p>In ancient Mexican America (at the Spanish Conquest)
there were Religious customs and National
usages not essentially of the Tyrian character,&mdash;yet,
through the vista of the innovations,&mdash;the "Daughter
of Sidon" was still discernible,&mdash;like the Statue of Minerva
in her Temple of the Acropolis, even after the
Sons of Rome had innovated upon the customs of
Attica.</p>

<p>All the innovations upon the ancient Tyrian customs
in Mexican America are traceable to an Event, about
three centuries and four score years after the Tyrians
first touched at Florida,&mdash;an Event not to be investigated
here, as it belongs essentially to the third Epoch,
viz., <em>the introduction of Christianity</em>:&mdash;but, to that
fact may be traced the immediate <em>cause</em>, of many innovations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
upon the Idolatrous customs of the Tyrians, in
several parts of Ancient America,&mdash;it led even to alterations
of the ornaments on their Temples, as will be
shewn in establishing the Event so full of Religious
veneration, and,&mdash;as a learned divine justly said, in receiving
<em>our proof</em> of the third Epoch,&mdash;so fraught with
Christian Sublimity.</p>

HISTORY OF THE PH&OElig;NICIAN NATIONS,&mdash;BUT

THE MIGRATION TO THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.</p></blockquote>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>(2349&mdash;1600 <small>B. C.</small>)</h3>


<p class="center">THE NATIONS OF PH&OElig;NICIA.
</p>

<p>2349 <span class="smcap">Before Christ.</span>] In reviewing the history of
the great Ph&oelig;nician family, an interest of a strong and
peculiar character is now given to it from the new and
apparent fact, that the Nations of that family were not
annihilated&mdash;in its literal sense&mdash;by the Babylonian,
Macedonian, or the Roman, at the great capitals, Sidon,
Tyrus, and Carthage.</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nicians as a people, will now possess an interest
in the mind of the English and American reader
(and of all Europe) of no common character:&mdash;for "all
time" forward the History of Tyrus (and of Israel) must
be regarded as being blended with that of the Western
Hemisphere;&mdash;and as a consequence, with the Anglo-Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
race: whose colossal tread, ere a century shall
have passed, will obliterate every minor footprint on
the Western Continent,&mdash;for the Institutions of Alfred
and of Washington&mdash;freedom-founded&mdash;tower, like
sheltering Palm-trees, over the desert sands of the previous
Nations.</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nicians claim with absolute certainty the
most remote antiquity for the foundation of their
"house;" for as the history of Nations requires no date
antecedent to that of the Deluge,&mdash;that of Ph&oelig;nicia is
traceable to that event&mdash;[2349 <small>B. C.</small>]&mdash;and as a consequence,
the first Book of MOSES is the fountain from
which all the channels of certain and early knowledge
are derived. From the Sacred Volume we learn that
the three and only Sons of Noah "were Shem, Ham,
and Japheth: and Ham is the father of <em>Canaan</em>."
<em>Japheth</em> was the eldest, and from him is supposed to
have descended the family of Europe. To Shem, the
second son, is traceable the House of Israel, and to that
august family was granted by <span class="smcap">The Almighty</span>, the
Sacred Covenant, the Holy-laws, and the Nativity
of the Blessed <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>.</p>

<p>The family of the youngest Son&mdash;Ham&mdash;is traceable
with the same certainty as that of his next elder brother:
while that of Japheth, the firstborn, is left in
comparative obscurity.</p>

<p>The branch of our History now before the reader,
contemplates the fate and family of the last Son of
Noah, and to those points only will attention now be
directed;&mdash;and at the conclusion the reader will not fail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to observe, that Noah's malediction upon the youngest
offspring of his last child, was not uttered by the insulted
Patriarch in vain. The cause of that curse is
familiar to every reader, but for the argument to follow,
it is necessary to bring it forward in this place.</p>

<p>2218 <small>B. C.</small>] "And Noah began to be an husbandman,
and he planted a vineyard: and he drank of the wine
and was drunken: and he was uncovered within his
tent. And Ham, <em>the father of Canaan</em>, saw the nakedness
of his father, and told his two brethren without.
And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it
upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and
covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces
were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
And Noah awoke from his wine, <em>and knew what
his younger son had done unto him</em>: and he said,
<em>Cursed be Canaan</em>; a servant of servants shall he
be unto <em>his brethren</em>. And he said, Blessed be the
<span class="smcap">Lord God</span> of <em>Shem</em>;&mdash;and Canaan shall be <em>his</em> servant.
<span class="smcap">God</span> shall <em>enlarge Japheth</em>, and <em>he</em> shall dwell in the
<em>tents of Shem</em>, and Canaan shall be <em>his</em> servant." [Gen.
ix. 20-27.]</p>

<p>The <em>Prophetical</em> part of the above, and its accomplishment,
will be proved in the last Chapter of this
Volume, and in support of the present Theory:&mdash;the
<em>Malediction</em> will here be especially noticed as belonging
to this history. It is singular that Noah's curse is not
cast upon the Son (Ham) who foully wronged his person,
but upon that Son's <em>youngest male child</em>,&mdash;viz.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Canaan. Ham had four Sons only, Shem five, and
Japheth seven.</p>

<p>"And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and
Phut, <em>and Canaan</em>."</p>

<p>The cause why the Curse was not bestowed upon
<em>all</em> the children of Ham, and their descendants, may
be as follows:&mdash;viz., Noah's last <em>grandson</em> was <em>Canaan</em>,
and being born in the very dotage of Noah (for he had
no child of <em>his own</em> after the Deluge), it is natural,
therefore, that his youngest grandson (and which was
the sixteenth) would be the object of his aged fondness,&mdash;(as
Jacob loved Joseph, being "the son of his old
age,")&mdash;this must have been known to his Sons and
their children, and when his person was violated by <em>his
own and youngest son</em>&mdash;the Patriarch&mdash;to give greater
power to his curse of indignation, cast it upon the
dearest object of his doting love,&mdash;reasoning thus: viz.,
"<em>My</em> youngest <em>son</em> hath wronged me,&mdash;therefore, <em>his</em>
youngest <em>son</em> shall suffer." We do not say his youngest
<em>child</em>, for that might have been a Daughter,&mdash;and the
Daughters of Noah, or those of his three Sons are not
mentioned in the Bible, although Noah's "<em>Wife</em>" "and
his Sons' <em>Wives</em>" are. The same Sacred Historian has
omitted any mention of the immediate Daughters of
Adam,&mdash;and it is evident they must have been born
before the birth of Eve's third son,&mdash;Seth,&mdash;for "Cain
knew his Wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch."
Now the Wife of Cain must have been his own <em>Sister</em>,&mdash;while
the grandsons of Noah must have married their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Cousins,&mdash;or perhaps Sisters. Some sceptical writers
have believed that many "Adams and Eves" were
placed simultaneously in different parts of the globe:&mdash;if
not, they say, "they (people) must have married
their Sisters." If such disbelievers had travelled through
even the paths of history, they would have found that
such was actually the custom, even after the Deluge.
Abram's Wife,&mdash;Sarah,&mdash;was his own Step-Sister. It
was practised in Egypt, and thought no crime,&mdash;from
the monarch to the peasant:&mdash;but, the progress of
Religion and Civilization, with their attendant radiant
blessings dispelled the darkness, and destroyed the
degenerating custom. Intellect was, also, thereby rescued
from gradual but certain decay: for experience
has proved, that the nearer the blood relationship of
man and wife, the more distant are children of such
marriages from intellectual or physical endowments.
This slight digression is introduced merely to shew
that <span class="smcap">Moses</span> omitted, in more than the instance of Eve
(previous to the birth of her third son), to mention
the birth of Daughters,&mdash;they are <em>understood</em> to have
been born,&mdash;attendant upon Nature,&mdash;like the bright
beams from the Sun!&mdash;but, the first Historian was
anxious only to record the <i>Sons</i> of Men,&mdash;as being the
recognised founders of the several branches of the human
family. However unjust must be viewed Noah's curse
upon an innocent object,&mdash;viz., his grandson&mdash;Canaan,&mdash;most
truly and terribly has that malediction been
accomplished.</p>

<p>The Arabs at the present day have an ancient law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
apparently founded upon the above, though in a reverse
position and partaking of a strong moral obligation,&mdash;viz.,
If a descendant of "Hagar's offspring"&mdash;Ishmael&mdash;shall
commit a murder, <em>among his own race</em>, the <em>Father</em>
of the assassin is given to the executioner,&mdash;upon the
ground of argument, that the Father had not educated
his son correctly,&mdash;for if he had, the child would not
have committed the homicide! This law has a strong
tendency to prevent crime, for the Son would not only
give his Father to the sword, and thus become a parricide,&mdash;but,
worse (in the estimation of the Arabs), he
would cast upon his Sire's memory, the lasting infamy
of having neglected his own offspring. To prevent
this hazard, the Spartan child was educated by the
State.</p>

<p>Noah's sentence upon his youngest grandson, for the
crime of that child's father, has never been repeated
from that day to the present period, or imbodied in a
code of laws,&mdash;yet has that sentence been literally accomplished
upon Canaan and his descendants. The
scriptural reader may, however, believe that the <em>principle</em>
of the above is again repeated in the Decalogue;&mdash;it
is true that a curse is there placed in contrast to a
blessing,&mdash;but (with humility we submit) that is upon
a point of Religious worship only.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt have <em>no other Gods</em> before me. Thou
shalt not make unto thee any <em>graven image</em> [statue],
or any likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above
[Sun, Moon, or Stars], or that is in the earth beneath,
or that is in the water under the earth.&mdash;Thou shalt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
not bow down thyself to them [<em>i. e.</em> Idols], nor serve
them: for I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy <span class="smcap">God</span> am a jealous <span class="smcap">God</span>, visiting
the iniquity <em>of the fathers upon the children</em> unto
the <em>third</em> and fourth <em>generation</em> of them that <em>hate</em> me
[<em>i. e.</em> worship other Gods], and shewing mercy unto
thousands [<em>i. e.</em> of generations] of them that love me,
and keep my commandments." [<em>i. e.</em> <em>not</em> to worship
Idols.] (Ex. xx.)</p>

<p>We repeat that the above sentence concerns <em>Religious</em>
worship only, and not for any <em>personal</em> act,&mdash;for that
is covered by the after-laws upon the same Tablets,&mdash;and
in regard to the crime committed by the father of
Canaan, it is especially alluded to in Leviticus [xviii. 7].</p>

<p>Of the Sons of Ham:&mdash;<em>Cush</em>, the eldest, was the
father of Nimrod, the founder of the Babylonian and
Assyrian families: the second son, <em>Mizraim</em>, was the
founder of the Egyptian empire,&mdash;thence the ancient
name of Mizraim being applied to that country.&mdash;<em>Phut</em>,
the third son, <em>apparently</em> died without issue,&mdash;at least
there is no scriptural record of his descendants;
but, as this would be very improbable in that early
date, immediately following the Deluge,&mdash;we will venture
the suggestion, whether the third Son was not the
founder of the great African family&mdash;known as Negroes;
for this is the only race not defined (apparently) by
Moses,&mdash;and Phut is the only child of the "accursed"
branch of Noah's "house," whose descendants are not
mentioned. <em>Canaan</em>&mdash;the fourth and youngest son&mdash;was
the founder of the Canaanites. Canaan had eleven
children, all of whom (except one) established Nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
known under one general name&mdash;Canaanites:&mdash;who,
as a people were subsequently conquered, and their
lands possessed by Moses, Joshua, and the Israelites.
The <em>first Child of Canaan</em>, however, was not included
with his brethren in founding the Canaanitish
family.</p>

<p>"And Canaan begat <span class="smcap">Sidon</span>, his firstborn." [Genesis
x. 15.]</p>

<p>From that "firstborn" of Canaan sprung the great
Ph&oelig;nician family:&mdash;for upon the authority of Justin,
an earthquake compelled a <em>portion</em> of the family of
Canaan to leave the country they had first settled in,
and they took up their residence upon the border of the
Assyrian Lake:&mdash;but which they afterwards vacated,
and journeyed to the Sea-coast, [2178 <small>B. C.</small>] where the
leader of that portion,&mdash;viz., <em>Sidon</em>,&mdash;built a city bearing
his name, and he thus became the founder of the
great maritime Nations of the Mediterranean; and being
divided from their brethren, the Sidonians became a
separate and independent people.</p>

<p>1689 <small>B. C.</small>] In the deathbed blessing of <span class="smcap">Jacob</span> upon
Zebulun, the country of Sidon is mentioned. [Genesis
xlix. 13.]</p>

<p>"Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and
he shall be for an haven of ships: and his border shall
be unto <em>Sidon</em>."</p>

<p>1451 <small>B. C.</small>] <span class="smcap">Moses</span> wrote of them as a Nation in
more than one instance.&mdash;</p>

<p>"And the border of the Canaanites was from <span class="smcap">Sidon</span>,
as thou comest to Gerar unto Gaza." [Genesis x. 19.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"&mdash;* * * from the river of Arnon unto Mount Hermon,
(which Hermon the <em>Sidonians</em> call Sirion; and
the Amorites [Canaanites] call it Shenir)." [Deut. iii.
8,9.]</p>

<p>In the last quotation the Sidonians are distinctly
stated to be a separate nation from the other branches
of the Canaanites.</p>

<p>1444 <small>B. C.</small>] <span class="smcap">Joshua</span>, also, defines them to be so,
and a powerful one.</p>

<p>"And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> delivered them [the Canaanites]
into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased
them <em>unto great</em> <span class="smcap">Sidon</span>," &amp;c. [Joshua xi. 8.]</p>

<p>The early character of National Independence enjoyed
by the Sidonians, and the primitive character of
justice among them, may be gathered from the description
of the people of Laish, who are compared to the
Sidonians; and the military prowess of the latter people
is also expressed.</p>

<p>1406 <small>B. C.</small>] "Then the five men departed, and came
to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how
they dwelt <em>careless, after the manner of the Sidonians,
quiet and secure</em>; and there <em>was no magistrate in the
land</em>,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that might put <em>them</em> to shame for any thing;&mdash;[<em>i. e.</em>
for crimes]&mdash;and they were far from the Sidonians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and had no business with any man." "And there was
no deliverer,&mdash;<em>because</em> it [Laish] was far from Sidon."
[Judges xviii. 7, 28.]</p>

<p>In the course of time there were six Kingdoms or
Nations of Ph&oelig;nicia,&mdash;viz., Sidon, Tyrus, Aradnus,
Berytus, Byblos, and Carthage. The inhabitants of the
kingdoms in Asia bore one general name&mdash;Ph&oelig;nicians,&mdash;though
each had its own name from its derivative,&mdash;as
Sidonians, Tyrians, &amp;c. The great nation in Africa,
was not included in the general appellation, but from
its Republican character, possessed its own,&mdash;viz.,
Carthaginians.</p>

<h2>HISTORY OF TYRUS.</h2>

<p class="center">ITS RISE AND FALL, AND THE MIGRATION OF THE TYRIANS
TO THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>(1600-1046 <small>B. C.</small>)</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">THE FOUNDING OF TYRUS&mdash;EARLY NAVIGATION OF THE TYRIANS&mdash;FOUNDING
OF THE MONARCHY&mdash;THE FIRST KING OF TYRUS, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Nation of Sidon having increased in power and
population, sent one of the Cadmii with a Colony to
found <em>Pæle Tyr</em>: this was on the <em>Continent</em>, or main
land of the Ph&oelig;nician coast,&mdash;23 miles from Sidon, and
80 from ancient Jebus (<em>i. e.</em> Jerusalem). The Mother-land
at another period sent a second Colony to aid the
previous one, and from which blended circumstance, it
is found in the Bible that Tyrus is called "The Daughter
of Sidon." The year in which the first Colony was
sent, is not defined, but it must have been many years
before the Conquest of the Canaanites by <span class="smcap">Joshua</span>;&mdash;for
not only were there in existence at that time the
"great Sidon,"&mdash;but, in dividing the subdued lands
among the Tribes, that of Asher received certain portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
on the sea-coast of Ph&oelig;nicia, and it is distinctly
stated that Tyrus at that period was a metropolis and
fortified.</p>

<p>"And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah
even unto great Sidon; and then the coast turneth to
Ramah, and to <em>the strong City Tyre</em>," &amp;c. [Joshua xix.
28-29.]</p>

<p>It is, therefore, evident that Tyrus was a "strong
city" anterior to 1444 <small>B. C.</small>, which was the time of
<span class="smcap">Joshua</span>, and the conquest of the "land of promise;"&mdash;we
have, therefore, and in reference to an event previous
to Joshua, placed the foundation of Tyrus as
early as 1600 years <small>B. C.</small> Some authors have remarked
that <span class="smcap">Homer</span> has not mentioned Tyrus, and as a consequence,
that that City was not in existence at the
period of the Siege of Troy. Homer mentions both
Mother and "Daughter" under one name; viz., Sidonians:
it was a term applied by the ancients to both
Nations, and to every thing elegant in Art,&mdash;until the
Tyrians by their superior skill won their own, and a
distinctive appellation. Nor can Homer be charged
with ignorance in joining the two names;&mdash;he followed
what appears from his own language to have been a
received custom. This is also proved by Solomon's
message to a subsequent King of <em>Tyrus</em>,&mdash;and the
Tyrians in their early days were flattered by being
called Sidonians.</p>

<p>"For thou knowest that there is not among us [<em>i. e.</em>
Israel] any that can skill to hew timber like unto the
<em>Sidonians</em>." [1 Kings v. 6.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Then to assert that Tyrus did not exist at, or before
the Fall of Troy, because the Epic Poet does not mention
it,&mdash;or that it is not to be found recorded as a city,
is to proclaim that which is not sanctioned by the consentient
voice of acknowledged history. We will briefly
review this point.</p>

<p>The Trojan war, consequent upon the rape of the
Spartan Queen, commenced in the year 1194 <small>B. C.</small>
Now in the previous page it is proved, that Tyrus was
a "strong City" 250 years before the Siege of Troy,
for Joshua speaks of it as one of the boundaries for the
Tribe of Asher, and this event was 1444 <small>B. C.</small>, and that
upon the authority of Holy-Writ.</p>

<p>Again.&mdash;Had such sceptics in the antiquity of Tyrus,
given a moment's consideration to the Grecian Fleet,
employed to convey Agamemnon and his troops to
Troy, they would have found that the Knowledge of
Navigation was first introduced at Sidon, and was, as a
practical science,&mdash;established by the Tyrians,&mdash;and
from them the Greeks derived their nautical skill and
knowledge.</p>

<p>Homer intended both Nations in the one term,&mdash;Sidonians:&mdash;but,
Euripides is more defined, for his
subject demanded it;&mdash;and as it has reference to this
History, as being the first recorded event after the
founding of Tyrus, it will be mentioned more in detail.</p>

<p>1493 <small>B. C.</small>] Forty-nine years before the period in
which Joshua divided the lands of Canaan, a Tyrian
Chief (<em>i. e.</em> a Cadmus) left Tyrus and Sidon (apparently
with a colony) and founded Thebes in Greece.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
He is known in classic history as Cadmus, and has
the reputation of introducing into his new territory of
Thebes, the ciphers of his country, and from which were
formed the letters of the ancient Grecian alphabet,&mdash;the
language in which Homer subsequently depicted
the deeds of Greeks and Trojans.</p>

<p>That the Theban Cadmus was a Tyrian, and not a
Sidonian, is established by Euripides;&mdash;as, also, the
worship of Apollo, and the Sacred Virgins. The Poet
has made a singular local error, as will be seen in the
second line about to be quoted,&mdash;for though the <em>Isle</em> of
Tyrus was inhabited in the time of Euripides, it was
<em>not</em> at the period contemplated by his Tragedy. It is
true that the Isle (previous to Alexander) was "sea-girt,"
but it is evidently intended by the Poet to have
reference to the Island-Capital, and therefore an
anachronism. The following translation from the original
Greek, will prove Cadmus to have been a Tyrian.</p>

<p>There can remain upon the mind of the reader,
(from the previous quotation) not a doubt, that the
celebrated Cadmus of Classic history was of Tyrus,&mdash;and
consequently it is the first name to be found having
reference to Tyrian history. The <em>chief events</em> only of
that history will be enlarged upon in these pages;&mdash;for
our aim will be to obtain, and delineate the vital
spirit of the Nation, and its principle of action,&mdash;that
<em>Instruction</em> may not be forgotten, in the contemplation
of History's wild romance,&mdash;for her prerogative has
ever been, to prove that <em>truth</em> is more strange than
<em>fiction</em>!</p>

<p>1444 <small>B. C.</small>] This date has peculiar importance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the fact, that from the words of <span class="smcap">Joshua</span>, Tyrus was
then "the <em>strong City</em>!" consequently having its walls and
means of defence; and by <span class="smcap">Joshua's</span> not attacking either
Sidon or Tyrus, it is evident that they were not regarded
as Nations of Canaan,&mdash;but as a separate and
independent people. It is, also, an important æra
from the fact, that one of the Tribes of Israel (Asher)
was portioned to possess the land of Canaan that
approached "<em>to</em> the strong City Tyre,"&mdash;thus were the
Israelites in juxtaposition with the Tyrians,&mdash;and consequently
it is apparent that the custom of Circumcision
(optionally) must have been introduced into the Ph&oelig;nician
family at this time; for it is recorded in the
Bible, that the great Covenant with <span class="smcap">Abraham</span> was
<em>discontinued</em> by <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, during the period of forty years,
while journeying through the Wilderness, and that
every warrior of Israel, who had left Egypt with the
Lawgiver, had ceased to exist: and thereupon,
<span class="smcap">Joshua</span>, as the successor of <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, was commanded to
renew the Covenant with the new race of Israel <em>born
in</em> the Wilderness. This was accomplished in the year
1451 <small>B. C.</small>&mdash;Now this was only <em>seven years</em> before the
Tribe of Asher were located in the immediate vicinity
of the Tyrians,&mdash;viz., 1444 <small>B. C.</small> The Egyptians received
the above custom of the Israelites, while the
latter people sojourned with the former, and consequently
previous to their Exodus from the Nation of
the Nile. By the Egyptians it was practised in the
same manner (excepting their Priests) as by the Tyrians,&mdash;viz.,
<em>optionally</em>. The Mummies establish this fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The facility of the Tyrians to receive this custom
was not only given by their vicinity to a Tribe of Israel,
but from the apparent fact, <em>that they both spoke the
same language</em>;&mdash;the original language of the descendants
of Abraham was not lost while they were in
bondage in Egypt,&mdash;because the <em>Egyptians spoke the
same language as the Israelites</em>!&mdash;These novel and
important points we shall endeavour to establish, when
reviewing the original languages of Ph&oelig;nicia, Egypt,
Israel, and the two Aboriginal races in the Western
Hemisphere, all of which languages will be found to
be the same!&mdash;and if this present History is correct,
those languages <em>must be radically identical</em>. Startling
as the above may appear to the classic or general
reader, we trust that his opinion will not be formed,
until he has investigated the argument of the present
writer upon the subject, and which will be found in
the Second Volume.</p>

<p>From the facility then afforded by neighbourhood,
and the means of communication by speaking the
same language,&mdash;not only was the custom of Circumcision
introduced, but probably many others of a minor
character. [1434 <small>B. C.</small>] The first war in which the Tyrians
were engaged was with this very Tribe of Asher,
who by their juxtaposition began to encroach upon the
Tyrians, and probably upon their Religious and National
Customs. In this first conflict by the Tyrians, they
were completely victorious, and drove the Israelites
(represented by the Tribe of Asher) from all the sea-coast
of Ph&oelig;nicia. This event probably occurred about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
ten years after the Tribe of Asher became located upon
the Tyrian borders,&mdash;we have, therefore, placed the
date at 1434 <small>B. C.</small> Malte-Brun states the fact, but
gives no date, or the causes that led to it. We have
endeavoured to look beyond the effect, and reach the
cause; for it will be remembered that the Tyrians had
their "strong city" on the <em>mainland</em>,&mdash;the celebrated
Island was not yet occupied:&mdash;encroachment was therefore
easily felt, and as quickly resented;&mdash;and like
their ancestors, the Sidonians, they were resolved to
live "quiet and secure."</p>

<p>There is an importance attached to this event, as regards
the History of Israel,&mdash;and to it may be traced
the cause why the great Hebrew family did not become
Navigators; for, being driven from the <em>sea-coast</em> by the
jealous Tyrians, all means of practising the art were at
once bereft them, and it was a position they never
recovered.</p>

<p>All historians agree in according to the Ph&oelig;nicians
the honour of being the first Navigators. Their locality
being on the sea-coast would naturally suggest to them
the means of carrying on commercial intercourse with
their colonies or neighbours,&mdash;and they were the first
of the human family so located after the Deluge;&mdash;this
is proved by the third descendant from Noah,&mdash;viz., Sidon,&mdash;founding
the first sea-coast capital. The Tyrians,
as the immediate branch of the House of Sidon, may be
believed to have practised the Science, in its simple and
elementary forms, many years before <span class="smcap">Joshua's</span> record,
that Tyrus was a "strong city;" or the founding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Grecian Thebes by the Tyrian Cadmus,&mdash;for that Chief
must have reached the Dragon-guarded shore by means
of a Galley. Euripides supports this position.&mdash;</p>

<p>The Tyrians were early renowned for their fisheries,&mdash;and
the produce from that toil became their chief
object of export. This, and all discoveries by voyages,
they guarded with a monopolizing and constant vigilance;&mdash;and
their peculiar characteristics may be traced
to the coastwise and early maritime expeditions,&mdash;for
they were acknowledged by all nations to be the pilots
and mariners of the ancient world. They had for many
ages no rivals upon the waters of the Mediterranean;&mdash;but
when by degrees other Nations were established
upon the opposite shores, or Islands of the great Inland
Sea, and availing themselves of the same means as the
Tyrians to increase their power or wealth,&mdash;then Tyrus,
ever jealous of her original strength,&mdash;instantly made
war, or piratical crusades, against those infant navies,
and crushed them even in their cradled security. Thus
early in her history did the "Daughter of Sidon" put
forth her hand and power, against every encroachment
upon her supposed prerogative, until she was acknowledged
as "Queen of the Sea;" and when Neptune had
placed the naval crown upon her brow, still so jealous
was this Ocean-Juno of her high station, that she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
allow of no courtiers or flatterers upon that element
where she had resolved to reign supreme:&mdash;nor could
she fear any decision against her, for no Shepherd of
Ida existed to give, at that time, a marine preference to
Athens or Cyprus;&mdash;the Tyrian-Juno admitted of no
argument, or comparison with her beauty, intellect, or
authority: she, therefore, cast the golden apple beneath
her imperious foot,&mdash;it withered upon her shores;&mdash;but
the seeds of discord were scattered by envious winds
to distant lands, and, in after ages, she found that her
rivals in fame were firmly planted, and thence enthroned
at Carthage and Alexandria.</p>

<p>The only city permitted by the Tyrians to practise
Navigation was Sidon,&mdash;and that permission was
founded upon the remembrance of their Mother-land,
and not for the purpose of promoting or encouraging
the Science. The same courtesy, founded upon blood-relationship,
was extended at a later period to Carthage,&mdash;(a
colony from Tyrus). From these family considerations
were created the ever-existing friendship
between the Sidonians, Tyrians, and Carthaginians.</p>

<p>For about five centuries and a half, Tyrus was governed
by Chiefs of the People,&mdash;each succeeding Cadmus
having the civil, military, and naval power,&mdash;not
granted to him as to a Dictator, but aided by a Council,
somewhat similar to the Judge and Sanhedrim of
Israel. The same causes may have led the People of
Tyrus to demand a King as the Israelites, and they
may have used the same argument. Not only that, but
the Tyrians may have received the idea itself of a Monarchy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
from their neighbours of Israel, who obtained
it only <em>thirty-nine years</em> before the Tyrians. There
seems to be such a singular connexion in regard to the
periods of the commencement of the first Monarchies of
Israel and Tyrus; for, by tracing the causes of the
former, a conclusion may be arrived at for the latter.
The following quotations will be found in the first
Book of Samuel [ch. viii.]:</p>

<p>"And it came to pass that when Samuel was old,
that he made his Sons Judges over Israel." * * * "And
his Sons [Joel and Abiah] walked not in his ways, but
turned aside after <em>lucre</em>, and took <em>bribes</em> and <em>perverted
judgment</em>. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves
together and came to Samuel unto Ramah; and
said unto him, Behold thou art old, and thy sons walk
not in thy ways:&mdash;now <em>make us a</em> <span class="smcap">King</span> <em>to judge us
like all the nations</em>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel's</span> celebrated remonstrance against the institution
of an unlimited Monarchy was useless.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice
of Samuel; and they said, Nay!&mdash;but we <em>will</em> have
a King over us:&mdash;<em>that we also may be like all the Nations</em>;
and that our King may judge us, and go out
before us, and fight our battles." Saul was consequently
anointed the first King of Israel,&mdash;this was in 1095 <small>B. C.</small>
Such an event could not pass unnoticed by the Tyrians.
Israel had passed from the flowing robes of a chief
Judge, to the gorgeous Mantle and Crown of Sovereignty.
The Tyrians had already received some of
the customs of the Hebrews,&mdash;that especially of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Circumcision,&mdash;and they may have felt that Monarchy
was becoming, in the scale of Nations, as a test of a
People's power,&mdash;and it would naturally lead them to
exclaim, "Let <em>us</em> be governed like all the nations."
Whatever the arguments of the Tyrians for a King,
certain it is, that in a few years (39) after the election
of the first Monarch in Israel, the Tyrians threw off
the Cadmean Government, and elected their first King
in the person [1056 <small>B. C.</small>] of <span class="smcap">Abibal</span>,&mdash;who, according
to Menander of Ephesus, and Dius of Ph&oelig;nicia, commenced
his reign in the year 1056 <small>B. C.</small> This record
is sanctioned by the Jewish historian Josephus, who is
supported by Theophilus Antiochenus.</p>

<p>An additional impulse would naturally be given to
the Tyrians in regard to a Monarchy, from the fact,
that in this very year the first King of Israel (being
defeated in the battle of Gilboa) committed suicide, and
<span class="smcap">David</span> (who was already in renown) was chosen to
the Sovereignty of the house of Judah: not over all
Israel,&mdash;that followed eight years after. Therefore the
<em>second</em> Hebrew King, and the <em>first</em> Tyrian Monarch,
ascended their respective thrones in the <em>same year</em>&mdash;(1056
<small>B. C.</small>)&mdash;and between whom there commenced,
and continued, a lasting friendship. It would therefore
seem that the ancient victory obtained by the
Tyrians, in driving from the sea-coast the Tribe of
Asher, had been acknowledged to the victors, without
any resentment from the united Tribes of Israel. As
the conflict on the part of the Tyrians was founded in
justice against encroachment, the descendants of Abraham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
feeling keenly the bondage they experienced in
Egypt, could estimate and appreciate a victory, gained
upon the very ground of argument which they themselves
had resolved to resent,&mdash;conquer or die!</p>

<p>Abibal reigned apparently with satisfaction to his
subjects, as he did not die a violent death:&mdash;and the
hereditary succession to the throne was established by
the People in the reception of his Son,&mdash;Hiram,&mdash;who
became the most celebrated of the Tyrian Monarchs.</p>

<p>Abibal reigned ten years and died in the year 1046
<small>B. C.</small>,&mdash;and from Scripture seems to have borne the surname
of Huram (<em>i. e.</em> Hiram), which has led some
authors to style his son and successor, Hiram the Second.
The following, however, is an extract from the letter
written by the Son of Abibal to Solomon, after the
death of the first King of Tyrus, wherein the father's
name is distinctly stated to be Huram. The letter has
reference to the Temple.</p>

<p>"And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with
understanding, of <em>Huram</em> my father's."</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nician writer, Dius, and others, style the
first King, <em>Abibal</em>, without any surname:&mdash;if it had been
borne, it is likely that it would have been mentioned.
It appears, therefore, evident that the National name of
the first King was Abibal only,&mdash;Huram (<em>i. e.</em> Hiram)
was perhaps the family name, and assumed by the
Second Monarch in remembrance of that fact, and in
affection to his Parent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>HIRAM THE GREAT.</h3>

<p class="center">(1046&mdash;990 <small>B. C.</small>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">BUILDING OF DAVID'S PALACE&mdash;THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN
TYRUS AND ISRAEL&mdash;BUILDING OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE
BY HIRAM&mdash;THE COMMERCE AND FLEETS OF TYRUS&mdash;THE
CAUSES OF HER WEALTH AND POWER&mdash;POLICY
WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES, &amp;c.&mdash;DEATH OF HIRAM&mdash;HIS
CHARACTER.</p></blockquote>


<p>1046 <small>B. C.</small>] <span class="smcap">David</span> had been King of Judah ten
years, and Monarch over all Israel two years, when
Hiram ascended the throne of Tyrus. The intimacy
and friendship between <span class="smcap">David</span> and Abibal were continued
upon the death of the latter, by his son and representative,
Hiram;&mdash;for it is recorded that the Tyrian
King sent to <span class="smcap">David</span>, at Jerusalem, Messengers of Peace,
Architects and Sculptors, and even materials to erect a
Cedar Palace for the Monarch of Israel:&mdash;a royal gift,
as magnificent as it was original, and (in our reading)
we do not remember that it was ever imitated. He
was indeed "a lover of David."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>1043 <small>B. C.</small>] "And Hiram king of Tyre sent <em>messengers</em>
to David,&mdash;and <em>cedar trees</em>, [from Lebanon] and
<em>carpenters</em> and <em>masons</em>; and they built David a house."
(<em>i. e.</em> Palace.) [2 Samuel v. 11, 12.]</p>

<p>In the Hebrew the word "masons" is defined to be
"<em>hewers</em> of the stone of the wall,"&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> Sculptors:&mdash;the
common workmen are identified by a term, as expressive
as can be desired for illustrating the rudiment
of the art,&mdash;viz., stone-squarers. [1 Kings v. 18.]</p>

<p>"And Hiram's <em>builders</em> did hew them, and the <em>stone</em>-<small>SQUARERS</small>."</p>

<p>For two years previous to the death of the warlike
<span class="smcap">David</span>, he gathered material for building the Temple of
Jerusalem, which by Prophecy was to be erected by his
son <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, [<em>i. e.</em> the peaceable]&mdash;for no Sovereign
whose life had been passed in the battle-field, and amid
scenes of warfare and carnage, could erect (except in
mockery) a Temple to The Peaceful GOD. During this
period <em>David</em> commanded that the Sculptors, who were
"strangers" in the land of Israel, should be gathered for
the purpose of commencing the Sculpture for the great
edifice. These "strangers" were, without doubt, Tyrians.
They had furnished Cedar for the building, and
they were, also, the skilful artists to work in all kinds
of metals. This calling forth of foreign artists to build
and decorate The Temple, is a conclusive proof that the
Israelites were not practical Architects or Sculptors.
The Tyrians had already built for <span class="smcap">David</span> his regal
Palace at Jerusalem, and were, therefore, naturally received
with every courtesy by the Israelites, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
probably remained in the country. In illustration of
the previous remarks, the following extracts are given
from the 1st Book of Chronicles [ch. xii.]:</p>

<p>"And David commanded to gather together the
<em>strangers</em> that were in the land of Israel: and he set
<em>masons</em> to <em>hew wrought</em> stones to build the house of
God" (<em>i. e.</em> The Temple).</p>

<p>From this quotation it would appear that the stones
were "wrought," or put into shape, by common workmen
of Israel (<em>i. e.</em> the "Stone-squarers"); and thus
subsequently the "Strangers" (<em>i. e.</em> Tyrians) were to
"hew" the stones&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> Sculpture them. <span class="smcap">David</span> gathered
material of all metals,&mdash;and the only wood he
obtained appears to have been the Cedar from Lebanon,
and for this he was indebted to the Tyrians.</p>

<p>"Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Sidonians
and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David."</p>

<p>The following is part of David's address to Solomon,
and refers to the accomplished Tyrians, as will be shewn
hereafter.</p>

<p>"Timber [cedar] and Stone have I prepared: and
thou mayst add thereto. Moreover there are <em>workmen</em>
with thee in abundance, <em>hewers</em> and <em>workers</em> of stone
and timber, and <em>all manner of cunning</em> [<em>i. e.</em> skilful]
<em>men for every manner of work</em>."</p>

<p>1015 <small>B. C.</small>] Hiram of Tyrus had reigned 31 years
when <span class="smcap">David</span> died. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> having been anointed
King during the last year of his father's life, was already
in possession of the regal power. Upon the
ascension of the "wise" Sovereign of Jerusalem, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Monarch of the Tyrians instantly sent ambassadors to
congratulate him on the event.</p>

<p>"And Hiram king of Tyre sent servants [ambassadors]
unto <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: for he had heard that they had
anointed him King in the room of his father; for Hiram
was ever a lover of <span class="smcap">David</span>." [1 Kings v. 1.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, appreciating the proffered friendship of
Hiram, and having resolved to build The Temple to
the One God, sent the following message to the Tyrian
monarch, for artists and materials to erect the edifice:</p>

<p>"As thou didst deal with <span class="smcap">David</span> my father, and didst
send him cedars to build him an house to dwell
therein, even so deal with me. Behold, I build an
house to the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my <span class="smcap">God</span>, to dedicate
it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense and for
the continual shew-bread, and for the burnt offerings
morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, and on the new-moons,
and on the solemn feasts of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our <span class="smcap">God</span>.
This is an ordinance for ever to Israel. And the house
which I build is great, <em>for great is our</em> <span class="smcap">God</span> <em>above all
gods</em>. But who is able to build him an house, seeing
the heaven, and heaven of heavens cannot contain
him?&mdash;who am I, then, that I should build him an
house, save only to burn sacrifice before him? Send
me now, therefore, a man cunning to work in gold and
in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and
in crimson, and in blue, and that can skill to grave
with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and
in Jerusalem, whom David my father did <em>provide</em> [<em>i. e.</em>
did bring from Tyrus.] Send me, also, cedar trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
fir trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon; and behold
my servants [labourers] shall be with thy servants
[artists] even to prepare me timber in abundance: for
the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful
great. And behold I will give to thy servants the
hewers [carvers] that cut timber, twenty thousand
measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of
wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil." [2 Chron,
ii. 3&mdash;10.]</p>

<p>In answer to these propositions for artists and material
to build the first Religious Temple in Israel, Hiram
sent his acceptance of the proposal in <em>writing</em>. Believing,
as we do, that the spoken languages of the two
nations (Tyrus and Israel) at this period were the
same (with such slight variations as localities might
produce), the answer being in <em>writing</em> confirms that
opinion, for it is not probable that the Tyrian monarch
would send his autograph letter in a language not to be
read or understood by <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>. Upon the elevation
of <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> to the throne of his father, Hiram sent an
<em>ambassador</em> to congratulate him. <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> replied by
an <em>ambassador</em>,&mdash;that was the ancient custom; and if
to foreign nations speaking a different language, an interpreter
attended the embassy,&mdash;but here none appears
to have attended, and so far from being necessary,
Hiram sent his last response in writing,&mdash;the
Bearer of the Despatch, without doubt, was a special
Envoy. A full investigation of the dispersion of languages
will be given in the second volume.</p>

<p>"Then Huram king of Tyre answered in <em>writing</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
which he sent to Solomon," [as follows] Because
the Lord hath loved his people he hath made thee
king over them. Blessed be the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span> of Israel,
that made Heaven and earth, who hath given David
the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding,
that might build an house for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and
an house for his kingdom. And now I have sent a
cunning man endued with understanding,&mdash;of Huram
my father's&mdash;[<em>i. e.</em> his father's especial artist],&mdash;the
son of a woman of the Daughter of Dan [<em>i. e.</em> of the
Tribe of Dan], and his father was a man of Tyre,&mdash;skilful
to work in gold and in silver, in brass, in iron, in
stone, and in timber; in purple, in blue, and in fine
linen, and in crimson: also, to grave any manner of
graving, and to find out [<em>i. e.</em> to invent] every device
which shall be put to him with thy cunning men, and
with the cunning men of my lord <span class="smcap">David</span> thy father.
[Both Father and Son gathered those artists from the
Tyrians.] Now, therefore, the wheat and the barley,
the oil and the wine, which my Lord hath <em>spoken</em> of,
let him send it unto his servants:&mdash;and we will cut
wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need;
and we will bring it to thee in floats [<em>i. e.</em>, rafts] by
sea to Joppa [a Tyrian seaport], and thou shalt carry
it up to Jerusalem." [2 Chron. ii. 11-16.]</p>

<p>The above artist,&mdash;the Tyrian Phidias,&mdash;whose
genius seems to have been universal, had been named
in compliment after the reigning monarch of his country,&mdash;viz.,
Hiram,&mdash;and the Tyrian love of the Arts
may be gathered from the fact that the "King's namesake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
was the artist-ambassador from Hiram to the
King of Israel. This special Envoy might, also, have
been selected in compliment to Solomon, for the artist's
widowed mother was an Israelite, of the Tribe of Dan
[the 1st Book of Kings states of the tribe of Naphtali],
his father was a Tyrian, and also, doubtless renowned
for works of art,&mdash;as it was the Tyrian, as well as
the Egyptian custom, for the son to be of the same
profession or trade as the father; thence the numerous
pilots and mariners of Tyrus. The same
custom prevails at this day in the ancient institutions
of China, upon the principle that as a king's son shall
be king, so shall every son be as the father.</p>

<p>For what the ambassadorial artist accomplished the
reader is referred to the Books of Kings and Chronicles,&mdash;a
higher compliment was never paid to the
Arts than by the appointment of an Architect and
Sculptor to be a monarch's ambassador to a foreign
King, and his representative at the building of the
chief Temple of a powerful potentate; and as if to
give peculiar character to the Tyrian Envoy's reception
at Jerusalem, <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> deputed a delegation to
proceed to Tyrus, for the purpose of escorting him to
Israel, that the chief artist of The Temple should have
those honours conferred upon him, which were alike
demanded by the solemnity of the occasion, the amity
of the King of Tyrus, and the intellectual character of
the artist-envoy.</p>

<p>"And Solomon <em>sent and fetched</em> Hiram [the artist]
out of Tyre. [1 Kings vii. 13.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Hiram the King not only, through his artists, built
The Temple of Jerusalem for <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, but also his
"house [cedar palace] of the forest of Lebanon," and
a palace for his Egyptian wife, the daughter of Pharaoh,
king of Egypt. For these services Hiram received
the promised gift of <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>,&mdash;viz., 20,000 bushels of
flour ("beaten wheat"), 20,000 bushels of wheat, and
of wine and oil 150,000 gallons each,&mdash;for an "Epha"
or "bath of wine," is a fraction more than seven-and-a-half
gallons. In addition to the above, which may
be received as for the Temple only, there was also, a
Treaty of peace and amity drawn up between the two
neighbouring kings,&mdash;to the effect that Hiram should
receive an <em>annual</em> payment,&mdash;that might have been
for the two Palaces erected after The Temple.</p>

<p>"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures
of wheat for food to his household, and twenty
measures ("baths") of pure oil: thus gave Solomon
to Hiram <em>year by year</em>. And there was <em>peace</em> between
Hiram and Solomon:&mdash;<em>and they two made a</em> <small>LEAGUE</small>
<em>together</em>:" [1 Kings v. 11, 12.]</p>

<p>The last line of the previous quotation,&mdash;viz., and
Hiram and Solomon "made a <em>league</em> together," may
have reference to a fact mentioned by Tatian, who followed
the records of three Ph&oelig;nician historians,&mdash;viz.,
that Hiram gave his <em>daughter</em> [we think his <em>sister</em>] in
marriage to King <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, and that it was through
her influence that he was seduced to worship Astart&#275;,
the Tyrian Goddess. This record by Tatian is apparently
supported by Scripture itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"But King Solomon loved many strange women
together [besides] with the daughter of Pharaoh
[Egypt], women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,
and <em>Sidonians</em>" [Tyrians.] * * * "And it
came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives
turned away his heart after <em>other gods</em>." * * * "<em>For
Solomon went after Ashtoreth</em> [Astart&#275;] <em>the goddess of
the Sidonians</em>" [Tyrians.] "And likewise did he for
all his <em>strange wives</em>, which burnt incense and <em>sacrificed
unto their gods</em>." [1 Kings xi.]</p>

<p>The King of Israel having broken his nation's law
by marrying out of his kingdom,&mdash;as by his union with
a daughter of Egypt,&mdash;it would naturally appear to
him to be no increase of the misdemeanor by intermarrying
with a Tyrian Princess; and believing that this
event must have been some years subsequent to the
building of The Temple, we have, therefore, hazarded
the date at 1000 <small>B. C.</small></p>

<p>The wealth expended by <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> in the building
The Temple,&mdash;his Palaces,&mdash;and that attending his
household, had greatly impoverished the national treasury,
and led to excessive taxation; and this was the
chief cause (after his death) of the Rebellion of the
Ten Tribes from their brethren at Jerusalem, when
those taxes were to be continued.</p>

<p>It must have been upon the exhaustion of the national
treasury by <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, that he obtained from
Hiram loans of money,&mdash;to be paid, not in kind, but
in <em>cities</em>;&mdash;and this borrowing by the magnificent monarch
must have continued for a score of years. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Tyrian King, however, refused to receive the proffered
cities or lands, as being unworthy of the donor or the
receiver, and he thereupon affixed upon the gift a
name, which is now as unpleasant to a Briton's ear, as
it must have been to the King of Israel. The Tyrian
monarch, to prove that he was not personally offended
(and perhaps to shew his superior wealth), sent to Solomon
a present of gold, in value over 600,000<em>l.</em> at that
period. [992 <small>B. C.</small>] "And it came to pass at the end of
<em>twenty years</em>, when <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> had built the two
houses,&mdash;the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the king's house
(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon
with cedar-trees and fir-trees, and <em>with gold according
to all his desire</em>), that then King <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>
gave Hiram <em>twenty cities</em> in the land of Galilee. And
Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which
Solomon had given him, and they pleased him not.
[Hebrew, 'were not right in his eyes,'] and he
[Hiram] said, 'What cities are these which thou
hast given me, my <em>Brother</em>?' And he called them
the <em>Land of Cabul</em> [<em>i. e.</em> displeasing] unto this day.
And Hiram sent to the king six-score talents of gold."
[1 Kings ix. 10&mdash;14.] From the expression "my
<em>brother</em>," it would seem (as we before hinted) that
Solomon married the <em>sister</em>, and not the <em>daughter</em> of
Hiram, although it may be regarded as an expression
of royalty. It scarcely admits of a question which of
the two monarchs exerted their royalty in the greatest
splendour,&mdash;whether it regards wealth or the arts and
sciences. Jewish historians have elevated Solomon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
truly at the <em>expense</em> of Hiram,&mdash;for it is expressly
stated in the Bible, that for "<em>twenty years</em>" Hiram
supplied Solomon not only with material and artists
for building his Temple and Palaces, but with money,&mdash;"with
<em>gold</em> according to <em>all</em> his desire,"&mdash;and added
to this, (which will be shewn in the next pages,)
Hiram supplied a <em>navy</em> for his "brother," for the
voyages to Ophir and Tarshish.</p>

<p>It should also be remarked that the liberality of Hiram's
character, and his toleration in matters of Religion,
are without their parallels in Ancient History.
This was known to <span class="smcap">David</span> and <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, for no other
monarch but that of Tyrus is applied to for building
and decorating The Temple.</p>

<p>This would not have been unnatural, or unreasonable,
had Hiram been of the same practical Religion as
that of Israel,&mdash;but he was essentially an Heathen
King, and erected in his own metropolis the most
gorgeous temples and golden statues to Jupiter, Apollo,
and the minor gods, and their splendour may be estimated
by what he erected for his friend at Jerusalem.
The language of <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> must have offended any
mind less liberal than that of Hiram's, for in his message
to the Tyrian he says:</p>

<p>"And the house which I build is great, for great is
<em>our</em> (my) <span class="smcap">God</span>, <em>above all gods</em>." [<em>i. e.</em> pluralities.]</p>

<p>This is a direct allusion to the worship of Hiram,
who believed that Jupiter and Apollo were the Gods
of "all Gods,"&mdash;but, so far from resenting the unintentional
rebuke by <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, he actually bestows a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
blessing upon the worship of his ally, though opposed
to his own, for in his letter he writes:</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel</span>,"<br />
</p>

<p>and that his actions should be in keeping with his
words, he forthwith entered into a Treaty to build the
first Temple to the ever-living and the only <span class="smcap">God</span> at
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Had not Hiram been king of Tyrus, he was worthy
to have been monarch of Israel; for the mind that
could have acted as his own did, upon so august
and solemn an occasion, was already prepared to reject
plurality, and believe in The One <span class="smcap">God</span>. What
a contrast does Hiram's character present to all the
Roman monarchs, from Tiberius to Maxentius, when
in a similar position from the introduction of Christianity!</p>

<p>From the foregone description of the Tyrian arts
and artists (and for details the Books of Kings and
Chronicles will testify) it will not be questioned
whether from personal knowledge and skill, they
could have built the Cities and Temples lately discovered
in the Western Hemisphere; but more especially
is the question now inadmissible, from the fact, that the
styles of the architecture of the Temples at Jerusalem
and Palenque, we have shewn to be analagous if not
identical.</p>

<p>Scripture does not warrant any Historian in writing
that the Israelites had a Knowledge of Navigation. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
has, however, been often stated that they had, because
Solomon "made a Navy:"&mdash;but, the sense is, that he
<em>gathered</em> a navy,&mdash;and this is proved from the fact that
Hiram furnished that identical "navy" for the King
of Israel. Navigation was the only point in Tyrian
policy, in which they resolved to have no rivals,&mdash;and
to prevent it, they supplied expeditions for other countries,&mdash;Galleys,
Pilots, and Mariners;&mdash;they formed
Treaties for this purpose with nations with whom they
were on terms of amity. Hiram followed the National
policy at this time with Solomon,&mdash;and the Tyrians did
the same subsequently with the Egyptian. Writers in
attributing to the Israelites a knowledge of Navigation,
quote from the first Book of Kings [ix. 26].</p>

<p>992 <small>B. C.</small>] "And King Solomon made a navy of
Ships in Ezion-Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the
shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom,"&mdash;but those
writers avoid quoting the succeeding verses,&mdash;and two
in 2 Chronicles [viii. 17, 18].</p>

<p>"And <em>Hiram</em> sent in the navy his servants,&mdash;shipmen
[<em>i. e.</em> pilots and mariners] that have a knowledge
of the Sea,&mdash;with the servants ["common-hands"]
of Solomon."</p>

<p>"Then went Solomon to Ezion-Geber, and to Eloth,
at the Sea-side [Red Sea] in the land of Edom. And
Hiram sent him by the hands of his servants,&mdash;<em>Ships</em>,
and servants that had a knowledge of the Sea"&mdash;[<em>i. e.</em>
pilots and mariners]. Now this last quotation has reference
to the same voyage,&mdash;and it is there shewn that
the Tyrians actually <em>built</em> the ships:&mdash;they were probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
framed and fashioned at Tyrus,&mdash;then taken in
parts <em>over land</em>, (for Hiram "sent them")&mdash;and that is
the only way the timbers could have reached the Red
Sea, from the Mediterranean,&mdash;and then the ships were
built or put together, by the Tyrians at Ezion-Geber,&mdash;and
from thence they commenced their voyage to
Ophir, (although some doubt the locality) on the shores
of India, and their return cargo was "420 talents of
gold." [<em>i. e.</em> two millions and a quarter sterling.]</p>

<p>We are anxious to establish the fact that the Israelites
had no Knowledge of Navigation, and that upon the
authority of Holy-Writ,&mdash;for the Aborigines of <em>North</em>
America (who are descendants of Israel) have no nautical
knowledge in its enlarged sense,&mdash;and, therefore,
an analogy will be proved by the absence of Commercial
Knowledge.</p>

<p>In concluding the reign of the most renowned of the
Tyrian Kings, the record of whom is placed beyond
doubt, or question, in that Volume which will endure
until the world itself shall become a clouded scroll,&mdash;a
glance may be necessary to review the causes that
led to the exalted, and unrivalled character of Tyrus:
for that Nation at the completion of the Judæan Temples
and Palaces [992 <small>B. C.</small>] was without a rival in
station or power,&mdash;and beyond those worldly points, it
stood unapproached (save by Israel) in the highest attributes
of the mind,&mdash;in the majesty of intellect,&mdash;the
chief ministers being Science, the Arts, and the long
line of faithful followers, attendant on every refinement
and accomplishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The great secret of the enviable distinction was,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Navigation</span>.
This power led the Tyrians into foreign
cities,&mdash;it enabled them to give, or receive from, their
Allies in the several parts of the then known world, all
that was useful or novel, <em>in exchange for their own exports</em>,
until Tyrus became the nucleus of all intelligence.
Upon this treasury of gathered knowledge she improved
and increased her power, by retaining what was
good, rejecting what was useless. Tyrus stood in the
estimation of the world like a majestic Temple, which
all mankind had aided in building, but when erected
and secure, none of the builders were allowed to enter.
If a foreign nation required a naval expedition, Tyrus
was the only power to furnish it in every department,&mdash;material,
shipwrights, pilots, and mariners:&mdash;this is
proved by the fleets loaned to the Kings of Israel and
Egypt;&mdash;and the Tyrians never made a voyage for another
country, that they were not the especial gainers
by the expedition. All discoveries of islands were their
own, for they alone could keep or reach them afterwards,
for other countries were destitute of fleets. The
Naval profession in the minds of the Tyrians was (apart
from Religion) elevated above all others;&mdash;they regarded
it as a peculiar gift from the Gods, bestowed
upon them as a National blessing. This was confirmed
in their estimation, because, as a necessity, it was associated
with the Sublime study of Astronomy. Religion
itself was brought to enhance its value,&mdash;thence their
Temple to Neptune:&mdash;the highest attributes of the
mind were brought forward to support the science,&mdash;thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
even her philosophers were helmsmen:&mdash;for in
the language of the Prophet <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>,&mdash;"Thy <em>Wise men</em>,
O Tyrus, that were in thee, <em>were thy Pilots</em>."</p>

<p>When a foreign Nation created a navy, without the
sanction of Tyrus, then, as before stated, the latter
country made war, or crusades against the vessels as
they should appear upon the Mediterranean. The
"Daughter of Sidon" attempted no <em>inland</em> conquests;
she was content that her throne should be on the Seas:
and the means she took to conceal her discoveries, and
the secret of her ship-building from foreign countries,
were as ingenious and determined, as her resolution to
have no rival was indomitable.</p>

<p>To conceal the then secret of Ship-building, the
Tyrians resorted to the following means of commercial
intercourse with all new, and even with some of the
surrounding nations,&mdash;ancient Iberia and Etruria,&mdash;viz.,
A Tyrian Galley would approach for instance,
Britain or Hibernia,&mdash;<em>only by night</em>,&mdash;the goods were
landed, and left unattended upon the rocks or beach.
The Galley would then be rowed to such a distance,
that the natives in the morning could make no discovery
of the manner in which it was built. The Galley,
however, from her high mast, served as a beacon to
them, and thence conveyed intelligence that a cargo
had been landed. The natives would then investigate
the goods,&mdash;and in return, place by their side, metals
and other commodities supposed by them to be of equal
value: <em>they then</em> (from a previous treaty) <em>would retire
out of sight</em>,&mdash;whereupon a <em>small boat</em> would leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Galley and approach the shore; the supercargo would
compare the value of the metals or goods offered in
return, and if found to be of an equal barter, the
Galley would then be rowed to the coast, <em>but at night
only</em>, the exchange-goods would be placed on board,
and having left before the dawn, the secret was secure.
If the natives placed in exchange <em>less</em> than the value,
the Tyrian <em>boat</em> would retire; the Aborigines would
again approach and increase the payment: if they
should place <em>more</em> than the value of the cargo, the
honour of the Tyrian merchant (truly 'Singer of the
Sea') was such, that he would not take the overplus,
but leave something of value, set apart, as a compliment
to the generous Islanders. This, without doubt,
was the origin of commercial barter, and founded upon
the refinement of honour and honesty.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that a similar custom prevails
even at the present day at Constantinople,&mdash;for when
a shopkeeper retires for his meals, or even for a walk,
he never closes his door or his windows,&mdash;every article
has its price marked, or affixed to it:&mdash;the passer-by
wishing to purchase, takes the article and puts in its
place the amount in money;&mdash;fraud is not known, for
the merchant leaves it to honour, and that never betrays
honesty.</p>

<p>The Bard of Avon must have thought of this scene,
and of the impossibility of its universal application,
when in reply to the announcement "that the <em>world</em>
was grown <em>honest</em>" he states that the day of doom must
be at hand! What a Millennium will be achieved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the human race, when every Metropolis shall practise
customs in analogy with that in the City of the Sultan,
or those of the merchant-princes of ancient Tyrus.</p>

<p>The determination of the Tyrians to keep the secret
of their discoveries was as desperate, as their method
of concealing the secret of shipbuilding was ingenious.
To illustrate this point of National Character, an historical
anecdote will be given, as being required by
this work,&mdash;although the incident occurred some ages
later.</p>

<p>The Romans having become a maritime power, and
having intercourse with Tyrus, ascertained that that
Nation imported from a foreign country a white metal,
which the Sons of Rome imagined to be Silver, and
that it was brought from beyond the Pillars of Hercules,&mdash;now
the Straits of Gibraltar. The metal which
had aroused the curiosity and avarice of the Romans
was <em>Tin</em>, and obtained by the Tyrians from the Isles
of Britain and Hibernia, but especially from the former,&mdash;and
to the Tyrians is that Island indebted at this
day for her ancient name&mdash;Britain,&mdash;and of her
guardian Goddess&mdash;Britannia:&mdash;for the word is derived
from the Tyrian language,&mdash;viz., <em>Brit-tan-nack</em>,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>
<em>Land of Tin</em>,&mdash;so that there is actually a mysterious
link in the chain of history, between Tyrian-Britain
and Tyrian-America, which has existed for more
than two thousand years!</p>

<p>But to resume:&mdash;The future conquerors of Britain
resolved to find out the secret, as to where the pseudo-silver
came from,&mdash;and consequently they, unknown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the Tyrians, placed a Galley in-shore on the coast of
Gaul, within the British Seas, and patiently watched
the approach of the vessel of their rival, known to be
on a metal expedition with the Islanders. The Roman
allowed the Tyrian to pass on without interruption
(for the two nations were at peace) and then followed
at a great distance unperceived, by lowering the mast
and sail, and depending upon the rowers. As the
owner of the secret approached Britain, (thus discovering
which of the Isles was the object of their voyage,)
the Romans hoisted sail, plied their oars, and
followed on their foaming track,&mdash;that <em>their</em> chance
for barter should be equal to the Tyrians. The latter
finding that they were discovered, instantly increased
their speed towards the Isle,&mdash;thus enticing the former
to follow;&mdash;all were silent on board the Tyrian Galley,
as if in sorrow at discovery,&mdash;the Romans gained
upon them,&mdash;the Sons of Sidon in apparent despair
threw overboard their cargo and all useless material,
as in fear of losing the secret,&mdash;the Romans believing
that the Tyrians by sailing close in-shore, and from
their loss of cargo, were about to land in sullen
silence, instantly renewed their energy both by oars
and sail; on sped the first Roman prow through British
seas,&mdash;dashing through the waves like a wild sea-bird;&mdash;and
on the silver track of ambition,&mdash;amid loud
huzzas, and shouts of victory, they were dazzled in
their own eyes from danger,&mdash;on they flew like the
Eagle of their country,&mdash;imperious and as proud;&mdash;when&mdash;sudden
as the falling of a star&mdash;the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Galley struck upon the wave-covered rocks,&mdash;the ship
was rent asunder,&mdash;all were lost,&mdash;not one returned to
the Eternal city to betray the secret! The last
Roman shout of despair at the moment of the defeat,
was caught, and echoed as one of triumph by the ingenious
and resolute Tyrians,&mdash;for they in the <em>friendly</em>
chase, threw over the cargo not only to lighten their
ship for sailing, but to pass over shallows, rocks, and
sands,&mdash;where the pursuer (heavy laden) would be
sure to strike;&mdash;and although the danger of shipwreck
was, also, apparent to the Tyrian himself,&mdash;his vessel,
"wise men" and mariners,&mdash;still to follow a national
monopoly according to the policy of his country, he
dared the hazard of the die, although life and wealth
were in the desperate game!</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, to be wondered at, that Tyrus,
from practising such devices and courage upon the
waters of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, should
have gained and secured to herself the title of Queen
of the Sea; but the Policy was not founded in brotherly
love, or neighbourly intercourse; and as a consequence,
the Tyrians were against every rising maritime
nation, which drew from those countries in return,
an unconquerable contempt for their pride and monopoly,
and compelled them to place so high a duty upon
imports into Tyrus, as by degrees to injure her prosperity,
and the several nations thence (as a necessity)
became their own manufacturers.</p>

<p>The writer (or the reader) of history would pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
his time uselessly, if he did not draw strong conclusions
for a nation's downfall,&mdash;when built upon such
an unjust foundation as that of absolute and unconditional
commercial monopoly. Nations of ancient days
should be viewed as beacons for the modern.</p>

<p>Although Tyrus visited every country, yet every
nation at this time (Sidon and Israel excepted) received
her with wounded pride,&mdash;no home or haven
was given from love, but from fear,&mdash;every hand was
ready to be raised against her; and when the fatal
moment arrived when it could be done with safety,
not a Nation, upon the surrounding shores of the Mediterranean,
but at once exerted the wished-for resentment;&mdash;and
this was but in accordance with Prophecy.
[Ezekiel xxvi.]</p>

<p>"Many nations to come up against thee." [<em>i. e.</em> Tyrus.]
This just behaviour the Tyrians knew would be their
doom; and in the day when the Judgment of <span class="smcap">God</span>
and of Nations fell upon them, they acted in the great
emergency, in a manner perfectly in keeping with
their ocean-spirit of Independence. We will not anticipate
events pertaining to warfare,&mdash;for the reign
now under consideration was one of peace and happiness.</p>

<p>Of King Hiram we may justly write, that he was
the original upon whom the Athenian Pericles (in
after ages) founded his own splendid public character.
For the love of the Fine-Arts, in all their branches,
seems to have been Hiram's dream by night, his reality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
by day. He gathered around him the wise and the
good, the gifted and the talented, to illustrate his own
conceptions,&mdash;for his brain was the casket, where, for
his Nation's service and that of his Allies, were gathered
those inestimable jewels of the mind, that wealth cannot
purchase, and Death itself cannot destroy,&mdash;for
corroding Time has hallowed them to the present day,
and will to all posterity! The Temple of Jerusalem,
erected to The One living GOD, claims not <em>Solomon</em> for
its Founder, with a greater certainty than it does <em>Hiram</em>
for its Builder. In following the above course, from
the direction of a superior and elegant mind, Hiram
but consulted the true glory of his People,&mdash;for he encouraged
not only Poetry, Music, and the Scientific
Arts, but enlarged his Commerce, enabling his kingdom
thereby to pursue the accomplishments and the
intellectual adornments of life,&mdash;for the Fine-Arts and
Commerce are as essentially the instruments of Peace,
as swords and spears are the weapons of war! The
country, guarded by her feudal Towers and Banners,
may be <em>physically</em> secure in <em>parts</em> of the kingdom; but
the Nation that points to the Walls of Artistical and
Scientific Galleries, to the Temples of the Muses, Literature,
and Education, and to <em>free</em> swelling sails&mdash;for her
Bulwarks and Standards,&mdash;is <em>intellectually</em> defended
in <em>every</em> quarter of her domain,&mdash;for Peace is the Citadel,
and the several branches of Prosperity, her moated
outworks!</p>

<p>Through the long life of Hiram (whom we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
ventured to style "The Great"), he continued the firm
ally of David and Solomon,&mdash;was the friend and promoter
of peace, humanity, the arts and sciences,&mdash;was
the uncompromising enemy, as a consequence, to all
warfare depending upon, or emanating from, the bloody
path of Conquest: and to these high points of character
may be justly added, that he was "the sworn
and covenanted foe" to Religious bigotry or intolerance!
The reader will not then wonder that, during
his reign, that Tyrus reached the highest point of intellectual
grandeur in the estimation of antiquity; and
from united acclamation, her triumphant Statue was
placed upon the chief pedestal in the Temple of History.</p>

<p>While Hiram lived, his mind was as a Pharos, whose
revolving light illumined every point to guard his fellow-man
from the rocks of danger, and to ensure a
peaceful haven&mdash;true Nature's harbour; but, at his
death [about 990 <small>B. C.</small>], the shade remained upon the
Tyrian quarter, and threw its shadow over the People;
while other Nations took advantage of the forecast
gleams, and found for themselves a brilliant track to
power and safety.</p>

<p>Such was the patriotic, peaceful, and intellectual
King Hiram of Tyrus, whose reputation has descended
with increasing splendour through a period of nearly
three thousand years! His elevated mind, extensive
knowledge, Religious toleration, the patron of Education,
Literature, Arts and Science,&mdash;the friend of oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
humanity, and the Patriot King,&mdash;are all again
revivified amid the applause of nations, in the person
of the present William of Prussia; and may posterity
record his memory to the date of his Tyrian prototype,
that his example may be imitated by future Kings and

THE DEATHS OF THE QUEEN OF CARTHAGE AND CATO<br />

AND VICTORIA.
</p>


<p>As it is the intent in these volumes to glance over
the ancient world with an Eagle's far-reaching gaze,
undazzled by its splendour,&mdash;and not as the mole, to
wander <em>beneath</em> the Ruins of Empires, clouded in
darkness,&mdash;the chief events only, therefore, will be
brought forward; for they were the <em>causes</em> of action,
and when they are understood, the <em>effects</em> will appear
not only natural, but unavoidable. Thence Hiram's
<em>character</em> was a cause,&mdash;peace and prosperity were the
<em>effects</em> of that cause,&mdash;so mighty are the deeds of one
great mind in the annals of a Nation! The Tyrant
Pygmalion is a direct contrast to Hiram,&mdash;and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
effects from that cause are not without their utility,&mdash;for
from evil, good is to be derived.</p>

<p>The next event in the history of Tyrus, is the ascension
of Pygmalion, who possessed every essential of
a cruel and avaricious monarch,&mdash;viz., never virtuous by
design, or guilty from accident. This reign brings us
also to contemplate the celebrated Tyrian Princess, his
Sister, whose virtuous life, heroic immolation, and the
genius of Virgil, have rendered immortal!</p>

<p>That the Poet did not follow History, must be apparent
to every classic scholar,&mdash;though the general
reader's knowledge of Dido arises from her association
with Æneas; yet this hero, who, at the destruction of
Troy, rescued the "old Anchises," lived three hundred
and twenty-five years before the Tyrian Princess, who
subsequently became the foundress of Carthage. Virgil,
in writing for the Romans, had selected the renowned
ancestor of their race as the hero; and as the
hatred between his country and that of Carthage was
deadly, he flattered the citizens of Rome, by making
the Queen of the former nation as the original cause of
the malignant animosity. Although this may be sanctioned
by that saving clause in writing verse,&mdash;viz., "a
poetical licence," yet in this instance, it is at the greatest
sacrifice of truth to be found in the records of History.</p>

<p>868 <small>B. C.</small>] Pygmalion ascended the throne of
Tyrus 868 years before the Christian Æra, and from
an after action against the life of a near relation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
that relative even closer allied by marriage,&mdash;his character
must have been cruel, bloody, and treacherous.</p>

<p>Acerbas the near kinsman of the Monarch, was not
only a Royal Prince, but also High Priest of the Religion
of the Country, and consequently of superior
knowledge and accomplishments. In addition to his
station by birth and intellect (for he was regarded as
the wisest man of Tyrus) he was, also, the richest
person in the kingdom, and in default of issue from the
reigning family, was heir to the throne. These circumstances
combined were causes of jealousy to Pygmalion
while Acerbas was yet unmarried. His immense
wealth may have been augmented by the then novel and
favourable results of Commerce; for, according to the
Prophet <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, the Tyrian "traffickers were the honourable
of the earth," and in "the crowning city" her
"merchants were <em>Princes</em>."</p>

<p>The sister of the King was the renowned Princess,
known in poetry and general history as Dido; but
whose name, while yet in Tyrus, was Eliza,&mdash;or Elizabeth,&mdash;which
name translated from the original language
means <em>an Oath</em>,&mdash;and as applied to its possessor
may be defined&mdash;<em>an Oath-taker</em>. It is therefore probable
that the attachment and devotion of the Princess
for Acerbas must have commenced in her earliest
days,&mdash;because her death (as will be shewn) arose
from an <em>irrevocable oath</em> taken by her of fidelity and
widowhood to Acerbas, should she in the course of
nature survive her betrothed. She, therefore, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
taking the Oath probably received the name of Elizabeth,
and from that circumstance, its definition, and
final consummation completely illustrate our supposition.</p>

<p>There was no Princess of antiquity endowed with
more enlarged attributes of the mind than the Tyrian
Elizabeth:&mdash;her resolution, active courage, intellect,
and womanly devotion were alike conspicuous, and
consequently she was worthy of being allied to a
Prince possessing the exalted virtue and character of
Acerbas. That the Oath was taken before the marriage
is apparent; for the Tyrant did not prevent the
union, but actually promoted it,&mdash;and from this deceitful
acquiescence on the part of the King, their nuptials
must have been solemnized amid the rejoicings of
the Nation and of the Throne. [861 <small>B. C.</small>]</p>

<p>The happy bride and bridegroom, in the consummation
of their devoted union, were blinded to the deep
scheme revolving in the traitorous brain of their King
and brother.</p>

<p>The honourable, yet fatal Oath taken by the Bride,
was to be continued as the Wife,&mdash;but its sacredness
could only be <em>proved</em> by the Widow. Upon the death
of the Husband, it was easy for the King to seize upon
the enviable riches of the Prince and Priest; if this
death should occur before the Princess was blessed by
the name of Mother, the absence of an heir would
place, by constructive law, all the wealth (except the
widow's dower) in the quiet possession of the avaricious
Tyrant. His Sister's oath formed a barrier against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
existence of any future heir,&mdash;and consequently the
death of her first and only Husband must be accomplished
with expedition, otherwise Nature might claim
her prerogative and adorn the Wife with the title of
Parent, and thus place before the Nation, not only an
heir to the Father's riches, but to the Throne itself. In
the foregone manner most probably the envious King
reasoned and reflected; and like the usurper of ancient
Scotia when contemplating the acquisition of wealth
and power, and when the virtuous means whereby they
could only be accomplished, were about to leave the
citadel of conscience, his resolution was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well</div>
<div class="line">It were done quickly."</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus resolved, the Royal assassin instantly carried
into effect, the demoniac murder of his Sister's newly
married Husband. [<small>B. C.</small> 861.] It is in trials of adversity
that our natures are proved,&mdash;and Woman at such
a time stands pre-eminent,&mdash;she treads the steps of the
fiery ordeal triumphantly:&mdash;though blinded by the
blow of fate, still her after-resolution illumines her
path, and proves to wondering Man, that the ploughshares
of cruelty have been heated in vain! Never
was this proved to a greater degree than by the Tyrian
Princess. Scarcely had Acerbas been thus basely deprived
of life, when secret intelligence of the deed was
conveyed to the Wife,&mdash;as, also, the cause which led to
it, and by whose authority the murder was committed.
Terrible indeed must have been the triple-tongued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
intelligence that conveyed to her the maddening truth,
that one act had made her a widowed bride,&mdash;a fond
Husband murdered, and her Sovereign and Brother
that cruel Assassin! In the whole range of fiction, or
poetry, there is not to be found a tragic incident, equal
to this fact from the romance of History.</p>

<p>Rising superior to her fate, her resolution was instantly
formed to defeat the deep-laid scheme of her
unnatural Brother: she felt that the base mind which
could encompass her Husband's death,&mdash;and in that
Husband the triune character of Prince, Brother, and
High Priest of their ancient Gods,&mdash;would not scruple
to sacrifice the Wife and Sister, but would rather accomplish
it, if Nature had already ordained that she
should become a posthumous Mother:&mdash;for Avarice
being the motive which led to the murder, it would
naturally lead to a further and a greater crime,&mdash;therefore,
in self-defence, and to preserve her Brother from
an increase of Sin, she resolved upon instant flight,&mdash;and
for that purpose a Galley was forthwith furnished,
and manned by her Countrymen. The faithful Tyrians,
by her directions, succeeded in placing on board the
entire treasure of her murdered Consort, together with
her own wealth and jewels,&mdash;the Galley cleared the
harbour in safety, and gained the open Sea without
detection,&mdash;thus defeating the entire Scheme of the
Tyrant, who had for his present punishment, the
assured conviction of his crime, the execration of his
Country, and the loss of the very object for which
the murder was accomplished. The perfection of retributive
justice was here accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>This royal assassination, and the flight of the Tyrian
Princess, occurred in the seventh year of the Tyrant's
reign. [<small>B. C.</small> 861.] These events were the immediate
cause of the founding of the Kingdom of Carthage,
which took place in the same year.</p>

<p>Upon the successful escape of the Royal and youthful
Widow, she coasted along the Asiatic Shores, and
reached those of Africa, and landed at Utica. There
are several reasons for believing that Tyrians had already
reached this spot, as some Historians have suggested.
The following are the arguments here offered
for such a conclusion: 1st. That the general name
given to the country at this time was Cadmeia (<em>i. e.</em>
Eastern), evidently derived from the word Cadmus, a
name borne only (as stated in the previous pages) by
the ancient Tyrian Chiefs. 2dly. The city, or town at
which she first landed was Utica [<em>i. e.</em> ancient], and
she named the Capital of her own founding, Carthage
(<em>i. e.</em> <em>new</em> city) apparently merely in contradistinction
to the previous, or "<em>ancient</em>" city built by Tyrians.
And 3dly. The fact of going at once to Utica, seems to
indicate that her reception would be certain, and from
no people could her sorrows meet with such sympathy
as from her own countrymen. Upon her arrival, and
her misfortunes being made known, it can easily be
imagined that every Tyrian would swear fealty,&mdash;while
her immense riches, that had been fatal in one respect,&mdash;now
enabled her to purchase lands, and build a
citadel and walls for future defence;&mdash;her own judgment,
and the skill of her companions, instantly laid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
plans for an enlarged and successful commercial intercourse,
which should outrival (as it did eventually)
that enjoyed by her cruel Brother at Tyrus. In addition
to these plans, she formed a scheme of Political
action, which, as applied to the perfect government of
a Nation, and which was consolidated at her death,
Aristotle boldly stated to be, the most triumphant, and
perfect, that had ever emanated from the human
mind!</p>

<p>Thus the Tyrian Elizabeth founded the kingdom of
Carthage, of which she was at once created Queen:&mdash;from
this period she is generally named by Poets and
Historians as Dido;&mdash;and Virgil, more than any other
writer, has for ages led the student into error in regard
to her true history.</p>

<p>So far as the chief events of Tyrus, or of founding
Ancient America, may be concerned, the future fate of
the Queen of Carthage has no connexion: but, it may
be permitted for the pleasure of the writer (and he
dare hope the reader also) to follow this devoted woman
to her death.</p>

<p>It can readily be imagined that the Queen of Carthage,
in her present position, both as regards her regality
and widowhood would not be without suitors for her
hand in a second marriage. Many surrounding Princes
approached her court to obtain that honour, but all were
respectfully rejected, not only in fulfilment of her oath,
but from her idolatrous devotion to the memory of her
murdered bridegroom. These Royal suitors received
the refusal with the respect due to her station, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
without any desire to inquire into the cause, or motive
of her negative. There was one, however, who would
not be satisfied with the simple denial,&mdash;but resolved
that if she could not be won by the terms of peace, she
should be conquered by the deeds of war;&mdash;even if, as
at a later period, that war should be carried into
Africa,&mdash;though the Catonian sentence "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Delenda est
Carthago</i>" should be the motto of his advancing
banners.</p>

<p>This bold suitor was Jarbas, the powerful King of
Getulia, who threatened to declare war against her new
nation, if she persisted in refusing his solicitation of her
widowed hand in marriage.</p>

<p>To violate her oath was impossible,&mdash;it would have
been a double perjury,&mdash;to the Gods and to the Dead:
to have married in disregard of her oath, would have
merged her own kingdom into that of her proposed husband's:
if she suffered war to be made upon Carthage,
her capital might be entirely destroyed,&mdash;her people
enslaved,&mdash;and herself the violated victim of the Conqueror.
In this dire extremity, she desired time from
Jarbas for full consideration of the alternative; and,
also, that the manes of her departed husband might be
appeased by a necessary sacrifice! The King of Getulia
at once was softened, and instantly yielded to her
reasonable request. The Queen, however, before she
made the proposal, had formed her resolution. There
was but one way to save her name and people,&mdash;to
keep her oath inviolate,&mdash;and to prove the heroism of
Woman's devotion:&mdash;it was indeed by a Sacrifice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
her Husband's departed Spirit,&mdash;but Death was to be
the Priest,&mdash;her Country the Altar,&mdash;and her own Life
the Offering!</p>

<p>With this resolution she commanded a funeral pyre
to be erected as for a sacrifice: she then gathered the
Ministers of State and her People around her; and
attired in her robes of Royalty, she ascended the newly-erected
Altar of her Nation's freedom! The surrounding
multitude, unconscious of her motives, listened
with breathless attention to her fervent and patriotic
eloquence: she urged them to perpetuate her laws,&mdash;to
renew their energies for peace or war;&mdash;upon her
death to place the reins of government in the firm
grasp of wise men only, whether they now wielded a
priestly sceptre or a peasant's distaff;&mdash;as she had no
child,&mdash;the offspring of her brain they must receive as
her successor! To these points of National glory she
demanded their oath. The vast assembly, gazing from
their elevated Queen to the azure Dome,&mdash;and, with
one voice, called Apollo, and all his host, to bear witness,
and accept their united and sacred Oath;&mdash;while
Echo caught the sound, and bore it even to the surrounding
shores and walls of Carthage, and the People's eyes were
raised to Heaven,&mdash;the Queen,&mdash;sudden as the flash,&mdash;stabbed
herself to the heart! The high-reared Altar
became the funeral pyre of surrounding danger and
desolation, for her heroic sacrifice appeased the claims
of the warlike king.</p>

<p>This act of the Queen of Carthage would be viewed
in modern days as madness; but to estimate it correctly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the mind must retire into the Temples of antiquity,
when self-immolation was regarded as the
highest test of pure and disinterested virtue! As
without a <em>similitude</em>, there can be no <em>comparison</em>,
either of Institutions or Nations,&mdash;therefore we can
only <em>contrast</em> our own with ancient days. This
difference in language&mdash;the mere instrument of truth
properly applied&mdash;has been the cause of great injustice
to events and personages of antiquity. We have
no just right to <em>compare</em> ourselves with the ancients, or
to measure <em>their</em> morals or virtues by the standard of
our own supposed perfections; and our posterity would
be equally as unjust to themselves as to us, were they,
twenty centuries hence, to record our actions and institutions
by their then received ideas of increased
and (truly so) advanced civilization. To be just, they
will in mercy to the faults and sins of their ancestors
(<em>i. e.</em> ourselves) <em>contrast</em>, not <em>compare</em> us.</p>

<p>The suicide&mdash;or rather in ancient phrase&mdash;self-immolation
of the Queen, was then regarded as the
highest virtue; and Cato, the Man of Rome, in after
ages (and at the same Utica where the Princess first
landed), but <em>imitated</em> the act of Woman at Carthage.
A <em>comparison</em> between these two acts <em>can be</em> instituted,
because, at the time of their being committed, the ancient
world regarded them both in <em>similitude</em> of virtue.
The same as the suicidal deaths of the Patriots&mdash;Brutus
and Cassius,&mdash;after the fall of Freedom at Philippi.</p>

<p>The Queen of Carthage, and Cato of Utica, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
died by their own hands, in full possession of their
minds and faculties,&mdash;both sacrifices to the highest
principles of national virtue; but how much nobler
was the Queen's than the Senator's! The former, by
her death, saved her People&mdash;the latter died uselessly,
and his sword pierced other bosoms than his own.
Cato ceased to live, because he would not survive the
downfall of his country; but by his death did he save
his native land, or even wrench a link asunder from
the enslaving chain of Tyranny? No! but had he
lived and returned to Rome upon Cæsar's invitation,
he might&mdash;he must&mdash;have rendered service to his groaning
country, and by his high character and talents have
saved her from suffering,&mdash;but by his falsely conceived
destruction, they were both lost to Rome and to posterity!
The Queen, on the contrary, by <em>her</em> death,
rescued her young nation from a war of slavery&mdash;gave
it additional power by her farewell wisdom, pronounced
from the Altar destined to receive her ashes,&mdash;bound
her tried and faithful Tyrians to elect their Rulers from
the scrolls of Intellect only,&mdash;the fulness of patriotism
was accomplished,&mdash;and as the steel pierced her heart,
Nature never received a last sigh from a nobler victim!
Honoured in life, she was idolized in death,&mdash;her last
words were as from her tomb, and consequently upon
the fall of the Queen, ceased the <em>Kingdom</em> of Carthage;
but from those Royal ashes arose, with Ph&oelig;nix
power, the Tyrian and giant Republic, which, in
after ages, sent its victorious army across the Seas and
snow-crowned Alps, even to the Gates of Rome!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen of Carthage died for her People&mdash;the
over-applauded Cato for himself alone; the former
cast her far-reaching gaze along the deep vista of posterity;
the latter only looked within the narrow circle
of his own death-chamber. The former died to embrace
the Public good&mdash;the latter to avoid a selfish
evil! Mankind have applauded man, because, in so
doing, they praise themselves. Thence Cato's immolation
has received undying praise from the pens of Poets
and Historians; and even the Tragic Toga has moved
in mimic life to infold <em>his death</em> amid Man's applause;
but Woman, when she is heroic as the Queen of Carthage,
she falls from man's envy, upon her own Altar,
never to rise again; or, if she does, it is only to falsely
move through the brain of a sycophantic Virgil; or,
for her true death to be given to adorn the final fate of
the Foundling youth of Argos, who, as <span class="smcap">Ion</span>, is to be
shrouded in a <em>Grecian</em> mantle, and for <em>that</em> people, and
not the Tyrian, received the wild applause of an enraptured
audience!</p>

<p>Woman does not ask Man to be <em>generous</em>, but to be
<em>just</em>,&mdash;the latter will secure the former.</p>

<p>Every good or brave deed traced by the pen of History,
should be for the purpose of Justice to the original
party, and for the effect of virtuous example to
posterity. Thence the self-sacrifice of the Queen of
Carthage was not without its effect (in the same land)
upon the mind of Cato, who, though he but imitated
the Tyrian Elizabeth, and failed to reach her high motive,
still her example inspired him, and secured his
fame!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>In like manner the glorious heroism of the first
British Queen,&mdash;Boadicea,&mdash;when she opposed at
Battle-bridge the Roman army under Paulianus, was
not without its effect upon England's Elizabeth, when
she addressed her assembled knights upon the threatened
Invasion from the then haughty Spain. Elizabeth
but <em>imitated</em> Boadicea: but in our own time it
has been the peculiar felicity of England to witness
<em>an original act of heroism</em>, by the present and beloved
British Queen: for when Regicide, like a wild demon,
stalked abroad unsecured,&mdash;and when the Sovereign
was within the arena of assassination, then it was she
threw aside the mantle of her own protection, to shelter
those faithful and dear to her; and to enjoy that
personal freedom, of which as Sovereign she is the
chief champion,&mdash;and companioned by her Royal and
noble Consort alone,&mdash;unguarded,&mdash;except by her GOD
and People, she braved the demon efforts of the assassin!
The Almighty in His mercy cast His mantle
over both! This noble act,&mdash;this self-sacrifice of
Queen Victoria to the interest and dignity of her
Nation, will live on to all ages, as a patriotic example
to all Sovereigns and Rulers; and for its true Courage
and Patriotism,&mdash;Religious dependence,&mdash;pure Heroism,
and her royal Mercy to the convicted regicide,&mdash;will
bear a triumphant comparison with any renowned record
in the Annals of Antiquity!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE PROPHECY OF ISAIAH,</h3>

<p class="center">CONCERNING<br />

THE OVERTHROW, THE RISE, AND THE FINAL FALL OF<br />
TYRUS.<br />
(FORETOLD 712 <small>B. C.</small>)
</p>


<p>The next circumstance claiming peculiar attention in
order of datum, is the foretelling of the destruction of
Tyrus from the lips of that Prophet, who announced
the advent of <span class="smcap">The Saviour</span>! The sacred writer
whose words are believed by both Jew and Christian,
the <em>time only</em> of the Messiah's coming being the question
at issue between them (apart from His attributes) must
be received as an evidence, inspiring both awe and
veneration; for it is founded upon one of the highest
proofs of Religion itself. Believing, as a Christian,
that the Prophecy of the miraculous Advent on earth
of <span class="smcap">The Christ-Immanuel</span>, was accomplished by the
<em>Birth of</em> <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>,&mdash;any and every Prophecy of less importance
by Isaiah, we receive with absolute belief in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
its accomplishment,&mdash;either past, present, or future.
This was our education in boyhood, received from the
lips of a fond and pious Mother,&mdash;it was continued in
our youth,&mdash;reason and reflection have produced firm
conviction in our manhood: nor in arriving at this
conclusion have we rejected or forgotten the student's
duty in solving a problem or proposition,&mdash;viz., that all
arguments should be investigated, either in favour or
against the question;&mdash;we, therefore, have attentively
read the writings of atheists, and all that have endeavoured
to refute the authority of the Bible,&mdash;the result
has been to increase and consolidate the belief first
obtained from Maternal eloquence, and to enable us to
pass through the Infidel-ordeal unscathed and scarless!
Even as a book of historic record relative to the house
of Abraham,&mdash;either collectively or in its separate
branches,&mdash;it bears truth upon every page; for although
written by Hebrew Historians, the <em>vices</em> of the
Rulers and the People are recorded, as well as the virtues,&mdash;the
former, for their own fame, they would
have naturally concealed, had not <em>Truth</em> been stronger
than any desire to obtain the applause of posterity
through the means of Falsehood.</p>

<p>When, therefore, a Prophecy of <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> has not been
(apparently to human knowledge) accomplished, our
religious belief teaches us that it has been, or will be
fulfilled; and if the Theory of this present work is
proved or admitted (from previous facts and analogies,
and those to follow), our faith will be still further increased,&mdash;for
we shall have lived to see another Prophecy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
accomplished, and (with the humility of the most
humble of <span class="smcap">God's</span> creatures we write)&mdash;ourselves to
have proved and established its fulfilment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> and <span class="smcap">Zechariah</span> both prophesied the fall of
Tyrus 124 years after the time of <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>,&mdash;but the
latter Prophet foretold its first destruction 140 years
before its occurrence,&mdash;not only that, but that it should
be regenerated as a nation after seventy years,&mdash;<em>and
then be again destroyed</em>:&mdash;these remarkable Prophecies
were accomplished. There was, however, another
portion of the last words of <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> in reference to the
Tyrian kingdom, in themselves a perfect Prophecy,
which was, and is, as we firmly believe, fulfilled; but
now for the first time so contemplated. The words
have been passed over even by Christian writers, upon
the supposed ground that they would prove a negative
in regard to the truth of Prophecy, and atheists have
availed themselves of that silence to advance their own
wishes; but Time, the chief champion of Heaven's
children&mdash;Truth and Faith,&mdash;has now established the
affirmative in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>The entire Prophecy, or rather Prophecies, regarding
Tyrus will now be given as uttered by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>,
they having been predicted in the year 712 <small>B. C.</small>, and
consequently next in chronological order, in reference
to the History now under the contemplation of the
reader.</p>

<p>We shall offer no minute analysis at this time, but
such remarks as may be required to explain the passages.
The lines italicised have peculiar reference to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the present subject. The reader will observe that the
prediction was uttered forty years after the founding
of Rome, and 149 years after that of Carthage, as expressed
in the previous chapter; and from the savage
deed committed by the tyrant Pygmalion, it will be presumed
(at least in argument) that every principle of
honour and exalted character, as possessed and practised
by Hiram the Great, had ceased to be exercised
by the throne of Tyrus; and probably so continued to
the time of <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, who, thereupon&mdash;God-instructed&mdash;uttered
the following triple Prophecy concerning the
Metropolis of the World;&mdash;that it should be
destroyed, but <em>that a Remnant should be saved</em>!</p>

<p>It should be remembered in reading the Prophecy,
that Tyrus was originally colonized by, and from,
Sidon; that the <em>Isle</em> was only partly inhabited, and
that the Capital, at this time, was on the <em>mainland</em>,
which was distant from the Island about half a
mile.</p>

<p>The celebrated Prophecy is as follows: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>"The burden of Tyre! Howl, ye ships of Tarshish;
for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering
in: from the land Chittim, it is revealed to
them. Be still ye inhabitants of the isle; thou
whom the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea,
have replenished. And by great waters, the seed of
Sihor [<em>i. e.</em> Nile], the harvest of the river, is her revenue;
and she is a mart of nations. Be thou ashamed,
O Sidon! for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of
the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.
As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be
sorely pained at the report of Tyre. Pass ye over to
Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. Is this your
joyous city [Tyrus], whose antiquity is of ancient days?
<em>Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn!</em></p>

<p>"Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the
crowning [Royal] city, whose merchants are princes,
whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?
The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride
of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable
of the earth. Pass through thy land as a river,
O Daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength.
He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the
kingdoms: the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath given a commandment
against the merchant-city, <em>to destroy the strongholds
thereof</em>. And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O
thou oppressed virgin, Daughter of Sidon: arise, pass
over to Chittim; there, also, shalt thou have no rest. Behold
the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not,
till the Assyrian [Nimrod] founded it for them, that
dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers [of
Babel] thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and
He brought it [Nineveh] to ruin. Howl, ye ships of
Tarshish; for your strength is laid waste.</p>

<p>"And it shall come to pass in that day [<em>i. e.</em> after
the first fall], <em>that Tyre shall be forgotten</em> [as a Nation]
<em>seventy years</em>, according to the days of one king:
after the <em>end</em> of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an
harlot. Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
that hast been forgotten: make sweet melody, sing
many songs, that thou mayst be remembered [<em>i. e.</em> as
in her early days]. And it shall come to pass after
the end of seventy years, that the <em>Lord</em> will visit Tyre
[<em>i. e.</em> give her strength], and she shall turn to her hire
[<em>i. e.</em> merchandise], and shall commit fornification
[<em>i. e.</em> have <em>commerce</em>] with all the kingdoms of the
world upon the face of the earth. And her merchandise,
and her hire, shall be <em>holiness</em> to the Lord [<em>i. e.</em>
they shall <em>prove the Sabbath</em>:&mdash;they did so at Jerusalem,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</i> Nehemiah]: it shall not be treasured nor laid
up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell
before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> [<em>i. e.</em> house of Israel], to eat sufficiently,
and for durable clothing. Behold, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and
turneth it upside down, <em>and scattereth abroad the inhabitants
thereof</em>. And [so] it shall be, <em>as with the
People so with the Priest</em>; as with the servant, so with the
master; as with the maid, so with the mistress; as with
the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with
the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the
gainer of usury to him. <em>The land shall be utterly emptied,
and utterly spoiled</em>: for the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken this word.
When <small>THUS</small> it shall be [<em>i. e.</em> at the second and last
fall], in the midst of the land among the people, <em>there
shall be as the shaking of an olive-tree, and as the
gleaning of grapes when the vintage is done</em>. They
[<em>i. e.</em> the remnant] shall lift up their voice, they shall
sing for the majesty of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,&mdash;<em>they shall cry aloud</em>
[<em>i. e.</em> praise] <em>from the Sea</em>!" [Isaiah xxiii. &amp; xxiv.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the Prophet's reflections have been omitted,
as not being prophetical.</p>

<p>That the reader may not think that we have made
an error in regard <em>to a Remnant of the Tyrians being
saved</em>, the following quotation from the same Prophet
is given, wherein the same figure of speech is used
concerning the fall of Israel, and the safety of a small
portion.</p>

<p>"And in that day it shall come to pass, that the
glory of <span class="smcap">Jacob</span> shall be made <em>thin</em>, and the fatness of
his flesh [<em>i. e.</em> race] shall wax lean. And it shall be
as when the harvest-man gathereth the corn, and
reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he
that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim. Yet
<em>gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of
the olive-tree, two or three berries in the top of the
uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful
branches</em> thereof, saith the Lord God of Israel." [Isaiah
xvii. 4&mdash;6.]</p>

<p>The comparison of the remnant of a nation, to the
few remaining grapes upon the vine, or in the baskets,
after a general gathering of the harvest, is used also
by <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> in prophesying the destruction of Judæa,&mdash;the
word "remnant" is distinctly used.</p>

<p>"Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my Soul
depart from thee: lest I make thee desolate, a land
not inhabited. Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts,&mdash;They
shall throughly <em>glean the</em> <small>REMNANT</small> of Israel <em>as a vine</em>:
turn back thine hand as a <em>grape-gatherer</em> into the
baskets." [Jeremiah vi. 8, 9.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The same simile is found in the Apocrypha. [2 Esdras
xvi. 29&mdash;31.]</p>

<p>The preceding figure of speech used by the Prophets
<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> and <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> was evidently taken by them
from the words of the first Lawgiver, spoken over
seven centuries before, in reference to the stranger's,
the widow's, and the orphan's right to the <em>remnants</em> of
the field, and of the fruit trees. This law is practised
and permitted even to this day, by that class of harvest-followers,
called <em>gleaners</em>,&mdash;the modern Ruths,&mdash;from
the original of whom sprang the all-charity <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>!
<span class="smcap">Moses</span> commanded that&mdash;</p>

<p>"When thou cuttest down thine harvest in the field,
and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go
again to fetch it:&mdash;it shall be for the stranger, for the
fatherless, and for the widow,&mdash;that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy
<span class="smcap">God</span> may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.
When thou beatest thine <em>olive-tree</em>, thou shalt not go
over the boughs again,&mdash;it [the remnant] shall be for
the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. <em>When
thou gatherest the grapes</em> of thy vineyard, thou shalt
not <em>glean</em> it afterwards,&mdash;it shall be for the stranger,
for the fatherless, and for the widow."</p>

<p>The <em>remnant</em>&mdash;or <em>gleanings</em>&mdash;of a Nation, as applied
to the Tyrians by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> must be apparent to
the reader:&mdash;its application to the present Work (together
with other portions of the Prophecy), will be
proved, as we advance, from the records of Classic and
acknowledged History.</p>

<p class="hanging">THE FIRST CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE CONTINENT OF
AFRICA BY THE TYRIANS, SCIENTIFICALLY INVESTIGATED
AND ESTABLISHED, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>


<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<h4>THE CAUSE OF THE EGYPTO-TYRIAN EXPEDITION&mdash;HERODOTUS
REVIEWED&mdash;THE COURSE OF THE "EAST-WIND," &amp;c.</h4>

<p>The subject now to be considered is of peculiar
interest in reference to the history of early Science;
and more so from the fact, that doubts have been
entertained by some Historians as to whether this
celebrated Voyage was accomplished, or even attempted.
These doubts have arisen from the silence of some of
the early Roman writers upon the subject, and subsequent
authors have, thereupon rejected the supposed
expedition. It will be our object in this Chapter, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
firmly establish that the Voyage did take place, and to
set the question at rest. This will be done not only
on the authority of the Greek historian, Herodotus,
but upon the higher authority of Scripture,&mdash;from the
words of the Prophets <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> and <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>,&mdash;which
will now be brought forward (as we humbly submit)
for the first time to bear upon the question.</p>

<p>The establishing of this proposition in the affirmative,
and beyond further dispute, has a material effect
towards supporting the Theory of this entire work, so
far as relates to the Aborigines of Mexican America
being of Tyrian descent;&mdash;therefore, the interesting
subject calls for minute investigation in order to sustain
the proposition. It must also be of interest to
the general reader, merely as an elucidation of early
Science, and especially the analysis of the celebrated
"East-Wind," so often mentioned in the Bible.</p>

<p>The suggestion by some writers that the circumnavigation
of Africa took place in the time of Hiram
and Solomon [1000 <small>B. C.</small>] cannot be supported by any
proofs, or even probabilities, but, on the contrary, is refuted
from two causes; viz., 1st, From the motive why the
Egyptian, Pharaoh-Necho, undertook, or rather resolved
upon the expedition,&mdash;which establishes it to have been
the first voyage; and 2dly, The <em>natural incident</em> or
fact, observed during the voyage (of this hereafter), and
which appeared so surprising not only to the Tyrians
and Egyptians, but even to Herodotus himself,&mdash;<em>proves</em>
that the expedition did not take place before the time
of Ithobalus, for the same "incident" would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
noticed whenever the first voyage was made, as it will
be whenever the last voyage shall be accomplished
around the Continent of Africa.</p>

<p>This Expedition was at the <em>expense</em> of the Egyptian
King, Pharaoh-Necho, who slew in battle Josiah, King
of Judah, as recorded in Scripture. [2 Kings xx. 3.]
The Monarch of the Nile ascended the throne 616 <small>B. C.</small></p>

<p>The ships of the Expedition were built by the Tyrians;&mdash;piloted,
manned, and equipped by them, and
consequently the voyage belongs to their history conjointly
with that of Egypt. Let us review the circumstance
which led to the Expedition, and the means of
defraying the expense:&mdash;the latter will be found to
emanate from the coffers of Judæa, and not from those
of Egypt. Pharaoh-Necho possessed a mind of no ordinary
character, not only in regard to government, but
for scientific pursuits. Six years after his ascension to
the throne he declared war against the King of Babylon,
and marched an army towards the Euphrates.
It was at this time that Josiah "the pious," King of
Judah, followed the Monarch of Egypt, for the purpose
of making warfare upon him and his army, and thus
prevent his approach upon the Babylonians. Pharaoh
used every entreaty to Josiah to entice him to return
to his own nation, as he had no wish to make battle
with Judæa, but rather desired the amity of that country.
Josiah, however, still followed on the rear of the
Egyptian army,&mdash;when Pharaoh suddenly turned upon
the Judæan force, before the approach of the army of
Babylon. The two enemies met in the plain of Megiddo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Josiah was mortally wounded, carried from
the field in his chariot, and shortly after died at Jerusalem.
His son Jehoahaz succeeded him, but reigned
only three months, when he was dethroned by the indignant
Pharaoh, and Josiah's eldest son crowned by
orders of the Egyptian, and Judæa placed under an
annual tribute "of an hundred talents of silver, and a
talent of gold." [<em>i. e.</em> 41,425<em>l.</em>] This event occurred
610 <small>B. C.</small>; and returning victorious to Egypt, Pharaoh
probably contemplated how he might best employ the
Judæan tribute, and make it available in the paths of
peace. From relative circumstances we are led to
reason that such were his thoughts,&mdash;for we now find
that he resolved to attempt the joining of the Red Sea
with the Mediterranean, or with the River Nile, by
means of a Ship-Canal between either of the two
waters. Egypt would then receive merchandise direct
from India, passing through the Straits of Babelmandeb,
and so through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Suez; and
by means of the proposed Canal to some harbour, or
commercial emporium to be erected on the banks of the
Nile, at the fork of the Delta, or at one of the mouths of
the river on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>This policy of a commercial connexion between the
Nile and Suez, and so to India, is again revived at the
present day, after a lapse of nearly 2500 years! At
this time, 610 <small>B. C.</small>, Egypt had no commerce of her own,
and had always despised the merchant's pursuit. She
had no navy or vessels of her own,&mdash;except her river
boats,&mdash;yet she was willing to receive from other nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the rich commodities derivable from their commercial
energy, and in <em>exchange</em> for her corn and linen
cloths; consequently the Egyptians were <em>merchants</em> at
the very time they affected to despise the means
whereby merchandise was acquired. To the fact of
the Egyptians really despising and rejecting Navigation,
may be attributed the <em>land</em> wonders of the Nile,&mdash;the
Pyramids and Temples:&mdash;for not being engaged upon
the Ocean, or the Mediterranean in any manner (and
to leave the river Nile for other waters was esteemed
a sacrilege), they of a necessity could turn their attention
only to the grandeur of the Earth,&mdash;naturally
or artificially,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> to Agriculture, or the Arts,&mdash;and
they were content to leave the domain of Neptune to
those who were willing to become the bold subjects of
his treacherous empire!</p>

<p>In the attempt to form a Canal from the Red Sea the
King of Egypt completely failed, probably owing to the
drifting sands; and it was this defeat in one path of
Science, that led him instantly to pursue another, in
which he would not have the same difficulties of Nature
to contend with; and in this resolve he was actuated
by the safety of his reputation,&mdash;for the new idea had
precisely the same object in view, as that in which he
had so signally failed;&mdash;viz., to bring the riches of India
and the Nile together by means of water communication.
The only way whereby this could be accomplished was
by a circumnavigation of the Continent of Africa.
There seems to be truth upon the entire subject of this
Voyage, from the fact, as already expressed, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
second scientific attempt, had for its object the same as
the first.</p>

<p>This is a proof that the Voyage was not attempted or
accomplished in the time of Solomon and Hiram;&mdash;for
if it had been, it would no longer have been a question,
but a repetition of a "foregone conclusion."</p>

<p>The primitive undertaking of Pharaoh did not require
Pilots or mariners,&mdash;the expedition now to be attempted
not only demanded both, but also Galleys and
"all the appliances and means" of Navigation,&mdash;these
the Egyptians, like the Israelites, did not possess, nor
had they any practical Knowledge of the Science.</p>

<p>There was but one Nation in the world to which
Pharaoh could apply, for carrying into effect this bold
and original undertaking,&mdash;that Nation was Tyrus:&mdash;and
with the Monarch of that country the Sovereign of
Egypt was on terms of amity.</p>

<p>Herodotus states that the Voyage did take place,&mdash;that
the Ph&oelig;nicians (<em>i. e.</em> Tyrians) were the mariners,
and of course the Pilots,&mdash;that they were three years
[609 to 606 <small>B. C.</small>] in accomplishing this then extraordinary
expedition. The glory of this victory over the
elements was claimed (and justly) by the Tyrians,&mdash;for
without them it could not have been even attempted:
and upon this occasion it was natural that both the
King of Tyrus and his subjects, would hail the opportunity
for such an expedition with every feeling of national
enthusiasm,&mdash;and to that may be attributed its
consequent success.</p>

<p>The proofs of the successful termination of the Voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
will now be established. The negatives will be first
reviewed. These rest entirely upon the <em>silence</em> of
several authors upon the subject during the time of the
early Cæsars: and because they were silent, subsequent
writers have taken upon themselves the responsibility
of contradicting it entirely: but that very silence of the
Roman writers (who desired only to advance themselves)
should be received as a direct acquiescence,
since they did not <em>contradict</em> it,&mdash;and they would have
done so if the negative truth had been on their side,&mdash;for
they must have read, or heard, the original statement
of the occurrence as made by the Greek Historian,
written in his description of his visit to Egypt nearly
five centuries before:&mdash;by being the first Historian of
the Egyptian Nation, Herodotus, or his work, could
not have been unknown to the Romans.</p>

<p>Upon the absolute refutation of a negative, and
proving the reverse, an affirmative, as a necessity, is
directly established. Here, then, follows one upon
that ground of reasoning: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>Some writers have affirmed that the Fleet could not
have been built and manned by the Naval Architects
and Pilots of Tyrus, <em>because</em> their city was on the
coast of the Mediterranean, and consequently could
not reach the Red Sea, except all the Galleys were
transported <em>over land</em>,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> across the Isthmus of Suez
to the place of departure, and this, say they, would be
impossible. Such annotations upon the solemnity of History,
only shew those authors' ignorance of the First
Book of record and Religion,&mdash;for in the Bible it is distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
written, both in the first Book of Kings (ix. 26,
27), and 2 Chronicles xiii. 17, 18, that Hiram the
Great built a Navy for the King of Israel, <em>at Ezion-Geber</em>,
near Eloth, in Edom, "<em>on the shore of the
Red Sea</em>."</p>

<p>Here, then, is the fact of a fleet having been built by
the Tyrians, for a foreign king, on the shores of the
Red Sea, and for a voyage to India. Now this Navy
was built for Solomon three hundred and eighty-five
years before the time of Pharaoh-Necho, the period
now under contemplation. Why should not the Tyrians
build another Navy upon the borders of the Red Sea,
at a later period, for another nation,&mdash;and especially
when for an expedition calling forth every energy of
the renowned Navigators? We apprehend that this
affirmative, founded upon a refuted negative, will not
now be further questioned even by the most sceptical
reader; and besides, it is more than probable, that the
Tyrians from the time of Solomon to Pharaoh, had a
fleet, or vessels on the Red Sea, and consequently could
quickly prepare for any expedition.</p>

<p>The affirmatives will now be established,&mdash;we shall
then endeavour to describe the voyage, the discoveries,
and safe return; and then prove that the entire document
has the Seal of Holy-Writ, stamped by the hands
of two contemporaneous Prophets of Jerusalem&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>
and <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>.</p>

<p>Herodotus says, that the Voyage was successfully
accomplished,&mdash;that the fleet, pilots, and mariners,
were Tyrian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us review the knowledge of this Grecian writer
upon the subject. The expedition is recorded to have
taken place 607&mdash;604 <small>B. C.</small> This is evidently an error,
and should be 609 to 606,&mdash;for Pharaoh instantly followed
his first attempt by the second,&mdash;and the first was
in 610 <small>B. C.</small> This last arrangement is also supported by
the words of <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>. The Greek Historian visited
Egypt, and wrote his History about 484 <small>B. C.</small>, deriving
his knowledge from personal observation, and from the
Priests of Memphis. The date, therefore, of his writing,
is only a hundred and twenty-two years after the
occurrence of the Voyage, and consequently not at so
late a period, that the antecedent truth should have
been lost. Again. He was writing of the Egyptians,
to be read to, and by the Athenians, who were always
proud of every glory claimed by the inhabitants of the
Nile, because much of Grecian science and knowledge
had been derived from Egypt,&mdash;consequently Herodotus
would have given all the fame to the Egyptians
concerning the enterprise, if he could have done so
with honesty; therefore, from the above reasoning,
the truth of his record is manifest,&mdash;for to another nation,
to the Tyrians, is he compelled to give the honour
of accomplishing the greatest Naval Expedition
mentioned in classic History.</p>

<p>We will now produce a proof (the most remarkable
to be true) of the accuracy of Herodotus as a writer,
and which will establish his authority to be believed,
concerning the subject now under consideration. In
his second Book of History&mdash;the Euterpe&mdash;he gives the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
reigns of the Egyptian Kings down to the Conquest,
by Cambyses the Persian. In the course of his writing,
we find a minute description of the three classes or
manners of embalming the Egyptian mummies.</p>

<p>In the highest class of embalming, he states, "<em>In
the first place, with a crooked piece of iron they pull
out the brain by the</em> [way of the] <em>nostrils</em>!" [Book ii.,
sections 86&mdash;89.]</p>

<p>So extraordinary a statement might well originally
have brought suspicion upon his entire History; but,
after a period of nearly 2500 years, his statement <em>is
proved to be absolutely correct</em>!&mdash;for many Mummies
of Egypt examined by Mr. Pettigrew (and others)
have been found to have <em>no fracture</em> or <em>incision</em> in the
skull: yet upon an after-dissection of the skull by the
same eminent surgeon, it has been found that the <em>brain
had been extracted</em>: thus proving to demonstration, that
it could only have been removed in the manner described
by Herodotus! When, therefore, the pages of
an Historian are established by scrutinizing Time itself,
to have been traced by the pen of Truth, and in such
minutiæ,&mdash;he may well be believed when recording so
important an event as the first circumnavigation of
the African Continent.</p>

<p>We may here observe (although in digression), that
from the accuracy of the description of Embalming by
Herodotus, and its late and absolute proof, not a
doubt can now be entertained as to the truth of the
unheard-of crime practised by the Egyptian Embalmers
upon the female bodies; and which led, he writes, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
a custom, or law, that the wives of the nobility, and
the beautiful or celebrated women, should not be even
prepared for embalming until the third or fourth day
after decease. Here, then, is the secret why the Mummy
bodies of the men of the first class are in better
preservation than the bodies of the same class of the
other sex. The men, instantly upon their death, were
prepared and forthwith embalmed, thus checking even
the first symptom of flesh decay; but with the superior
or beautiful women, a delay took place of three or
four days, for the express purpose of preventing the
crime, which could only be done by the commencement
of decomposition; and which decay, all the art of
the Embalmers could never restore to that state when
Death first made the fleshy-walls his chosen habitation!</p>

<p>Another, and a conclusive proof of the truth of
Herodotus in regard to this Voyage, will be given at
the conclusion of this Chapter.</p>

<p>This expedition was repeated, upon the authority of
Pliny, by the Egyptians <em>themselves</em> nearly 500 years
after the first expedition by the Tyrians. This second
undertaking was piloted by Eudoxus, at the command
and expense of Ptolemy Lathyrus. The Greco-Egyptians
had, during his reign (<small>B. C.</small> 116), become a powerful commercial
nation,&mdash;Alexandria having been founded 215
years before by the warrior whose name was given to
the emporium. The Voyage by Eudoxus seems to have
been but the <em>imitation</em> of a previous one,&mdash;with this
exception, viz., that the pride of the Egyptians was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
called into action, to equal the former glory achieved
by the Tyrians; and consequently in this voyage they
had their own pilots, vessels, and mariners. Even the
cognomen of this Ptolemy,&mdash;viz., Lathyrus,&mdash;(by simply
omitting the letter-h,&mdash;or pronouncing it hard, as in
thyme,&mdash;a herb) would seem to have some hidden
meaning in reference to that pride. The nomen Ptolemy
was a general name possessed by a long line of Kings
from the death of Alexander,&mdash;as Pharaoh had been
ages before the Macedonian,&mdash;but the cognomen, or
surname was placed, or used, for some great event
connected with the history of the possessor. The Romans
practised this custom,&mdash;as instanced in the case of
Scipio,&mdash;surnamed Africanus;&mdash;one of their Emperors
received the cognomen of Germanicus,&mdash;and at an
earlier period, Caius Marcius received the surname of
Coriolanus,&mdash;all these were given for victories in the
countries, of which their names of honourable distinction
were the derivatives. In reference, therefore, to
the surname Lathyrus,&mdash;by the omission, or hard
sound of H, or by its silence as the letter P,&mdash;in the original
name,&mdash;it would read Ptolemy Latyrus, and which
might be easily rendered, in direct allusion to the second
great Voyage having equalled the first.&mdash;<em>Ptolemy the
Tyrian.</em></p>

<p>Enough has been adduced in support of the Expedition,
as mentioned by Herodotus, to authorize a continuation
of the subject.</p>

<p>In order to give a perfect illustration to the following
remarks, and to the extracts from Scripture, a full elucidation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of the celebrated "East-Wind" will be required,
not only for the general reader, but for the advancement
of this work. To facilitate the explanations, the reader
should have before him a Map of the Atlantic Ocean
(or a terrestrial globe), and observe where the Equator,
or the equinoctial line, crosses the waters from the continent
of Africa to that of America. It will be found
to cross the shore of Nazareth Bay (Gulf of Guinea) on
Africa,&mdash;and Jones' Land (at the mouth of the river
Amazon) on America. This line (of course) passes
around the entire globe. The reader will then trace
30 degrees of latitude from that line, both towards the
North and the South Pole. Towards the <em>North</em> Pole
the line of 30 degrees (crossing the Atlantic) touches
at the point of the kingdom of Morocco on Africa, <em>enclosing
within that line the Fortunate Isles</em> (<em>i. e.</em> the
Canaries): on America it touches at St. Augustine,&mdash;<em>enclosing
within the same line all of Florida</em>. The two
sentences in Italics will be referred to in the subsequent
pages. Towards the <em>South</em> Pole the line of 30 degrees
touches at the minor Namquois river on Africa,
and at Tramaday on the American Continent. Now
between these 60 degrees,&mdash;the Equator forming the
centre,&mdash;<em>there is a</em> <span class="smcap">perpetual East-Wind</span> <em>blowing</em>
<small>FROM</small> <em>Africa across the Atlantic</em> <small>TO</small> <em>America</em>, and so
around the Earth,&mdash;from East to West on our diurnal,
and West to East on our nocturnal hemisphere.</p>

<p>This current of air has been called in modern times&mdash;the
<em>Trade</em> Wind,&mdash;a name evidently derived from
the facility given by it to commercial intercourse, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Europe, Africa and India, with Central South America,
and the West India Islands. It is, however, in
the Bible always mentioned as the <em>East-Wind</em>, and as
a proof of the truth of Scriptural record, (apart from its
Religion) wherever a city or place is stated to have
been effected by this East-Wind, <em>it will be found to be
within the 60 degrees</em> (as detailed above) on Asia or
Africa! Thus Science will support Scriptural record,
although some writers have hazarded the contrary
assertion. This ancient phenomenon (which is now
explained by Science) must have been encountered by
the Tyrians during this celebrated voyage, and is alluded
to by the Prophet <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>,&mdash;as will be shewn
in proof that this expedition was accomplished.</p>

<p>The reader will remember that this perpetual East
Wind blows <em>from</em> the African <em>to</em> the American Continent;&mdash;any
vessel, therefore, going <em>to</em> the Western Hemisphere
(within the degrees specified) with its sails
set,&mdash;square before the wind, and its rudder secured on
its centre,&mdash;the ship would then reach America (tempests
excepted) without a single seaman or pilot to man
or steer the vessel: and as a consequence, therefore,
any ship <em>from</em> America to Europe or Africa,&mdash;or from
India, having doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and
coasting along the western coast of Africa (and being
within the 60 degrees), would <em>meet</em> that East-Wind,&mdash;and
would have to encounter what is technically called
"a head wind,"&mdash;and consequently be in great danger
of being "broken in the midst of the Seas" and there
foundering; and especially in crossing in the line of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Equator; for directly over that line is the Sun nearest
to the Globe,&mdash;varying (of course) according to the
seasonal changes.</p>

<p>This constant current of air,&mdash;this Boræan Mercury,
capped and heeled with wings of Light,&mdash;passes from
Africa over the broad Atlantic,&mdash;crossing the Continent
of America and the great Pacific, he pursues his faithful
flight over the vast lands of China, Australia, and
Hindoostan,&mdash;is borne across the waters of the Indian
Ocean, the Sea of Oman and the Gulf of Persia; the
sands of Arabia, and the wall-divided sea of Israel;
avoiding Europe and the Mediterranean, he reaches
his fiery and cradled-home on Afric's burning deserts;
but no cessation is here given to his perpetual course,
his energies are but renewed, and on he speeds,&mdash;his
"royal progress," commenced at Creation's birth, and
must continue until Nature ceases,&mdash;the glorious Sun
his mighty Parent,&mdash;Light itself his swift-speeding
herald,&mdash;the Breeze, Gale, Storm, and Hurricane his
children and attendants,&mdash;the golden eyes of Heaven,
with their princely North-star, the witnesses of his constancy,&mdash;Earth
and Ocean his grand and gorgeous
kingdoms,&mdash;the central line of the entire Globe, and
for two thousand miles on either side, his broad and
majestic pathway! Man, his only opponent;&mdash;his only
conqueror,&mdash;Science,&mdash;the imaged mind of that <span class="smcap">God</span>,
who in the Eden of the Universe planted the undying
Trees of Knowledge and of Life.</p>

<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<h4>A SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE "EAST-WIND," AND OF THE
MEANS FOR ACCOMPLISHING THE VOYAGE, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>A scientific analysis of the cause of this perpetual
Easterly Wind may be acceptable to the general
reader,&mdash;it is also required by the subject matter of
this volume,&mdash;for the Tyrians had no knowledge of the
cause, they but experienced the effects,&mdash;and this upon
two occasions,&mdash;once in opposing its power, and
at another time in receiving its friendly aid. Columbus
received the same during his voyage, which was accomplished
entirely by this East-Wind,&mdash;it not only
wafted him with continuous speed and safety, but it
also subdued the fierce elements of human conflict, as
threatened by the mutiny of his crew. Upon the success,
he and his companions regarded the perpetual
wind blowing towards the Western Continent as a
Providential interposition in their behalf! Such was
the superstition only four centuries and a half ago; but
Columbus merely followed a track, (and also from the
<em>Canary Isles</em>) which had been ploughed by Tyrian Galleys,
<em>eighteen centuries before</em>; and wafted by the same
ceaseless wind, he reached an island <em>in a direct westerly
line</em>, with the land or point of "Florida" first
"touched" by his Ph&oelig;nician predecessors! This we
believe, in the subsequent volumes, will be firmly
established. But to the analysis of this Orient Gale
ever blowing towards the Occident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>We will first suppose (for illustration) that the Earth
should suddenly cease its diurnal revolution, and become
absolutely stationary;&mdash;in that case all the currents
of air (winds) would rush from every part of
the Globe towards that point over which the Sun (at
the moment of the Earth's fixedness) should be vertical:
and the Sun producing a partial vacuum by its
heat, would cause the various currents of wind to
leave the Globe, and rise in the form of a cone towards
the immediate source of heat, and so rush with more
or less fury, according to the degrees of the vacuum
produced. Now from this contemplation of the action
of air, upon the Earth being stationary, simply view
the Globe in its <em>revolving</em> condition according to its
eternal law,&mdash;our diurnal hemisphere ever turning
<small>FROM</small> <em>West</em> <small>TO</small> <em>East</em>,&mdash;producing the natural fact, that
every spot of earth (in the same latitude) holds nearly
the same locality in infinite space once in every twenty-four
hours! The Sun (for this second illustration)
will be viewed as stationary,&mdash;and is nearest to the
earth at the line farthest and most central from the
North and South poles,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> at the Equator,&mdash;the currents
of air as a necessity pass from East <em>to</em> West (the
<em>reverse</em> of the Earth's action) following the principles
of rushing towards the partial vacuum created by the
Sun's intensity. As the Sun is farther from the Poles
than from the line of the Equator, so the East-Wind
diminishes in ratio force towards the Poles (for the
cold airs are attracted from them) and increases in the
same degree of ratio in approaching the line from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
whence the North and South latitudes are measured.
The distance, as already stated, is thirty degrees on
either side of the Equator, thus forming by the laws of
Nature a perpetual East-Wind encircling one hemisphere
(and a West-Wind the other), and spreading to
the width of 3600 miles around the entire Globe!</p>

<p>This fact enables us to elucidate a portion of Scripture
having reference to the celebrated Passage of the
Red Sea by the Israelites, which will be investigated in
the next volume.</p>

<p>The principle of nature established in its law of
attracting air even towards a partial vacuum, be it
created by natural or artificial means of heat (for
the quality of the result is the same) has been
shewn to prove, that the Earth revolving one way,
(West to East) and the current of air rushing another,
having the Sun as its source of attraction, must of a
necessity produce the constant East-Wind. This secret
of Nature instantly unfolds why the great Ocean on
the <em>Western</em> coast of America is truly named <em>Pacific</em>,
when compared to the tempests of the Atlantic. As
thus:&mdash;the hot sands of Africa for man adjunct power to
the Sun in creating an increased yet partial vacuum,&mdash;the
winds, therefore, are attracted with doubled quantity
on Africa,&mdash;thence the Simooms; but being compelled
by Nature's law to follow (as it were) to the
Sun, the quantity consequently drawn from Africa to
its immediate neighbour, the Atlantic, is in the ratio of
acquisition at the original source, Africa; but when
on the Atlantic, the waters&mdash;not possessing the sand-heat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and thence losing the concentration&mdash;disperse
the mass of storm-winds, and they pass over the Atlantic,
gradually losing their force as they are removed
from Africa; and in crossing over the American Continent,
having no longer the hot sands to regenerate
the increased vacuum, the East-Wind reaches the great
Ocean truly in a <em>Pacific</em> state; and so continues around
the Globe, until it comes within the influence of the
furnace sands, when it again commences its impetuous
course, and thence on to the Atlantic. The name&mdash;<em>Pacific
Ocean</em>, was given from an absolute truth&mdash;an
<em>effect</em>,&mdash;not from an analysis of the <em>cause</em>,&mdash;we humbly
submit that the latter is now produced.</p>

<p>Upon the same principle, the burning sands of Arabia,
which are unendurable during the day, owing to
the excessive heat contained,&mdash;possess at night the
cool and reviving air;&mdash;it does not so much pass over
the desert (in the absence of the Sun) as it is actually
<em>drawn down vertically upon the sands</em>, like an avalanche;&mdash;for
the cold air of the upper region, upon
feeling the effects, and attraction of the substratum of heat,
must follow the established principle,&mdash;as, also, the greater
weight of the cold air follows the law of gravitation.</p>

<p>Pursuing this reasoning upon <em>effect</em> from <em>cause</em>, (and
without which we cannot advance in wisdom) the
following singular result must not only be apparent,
but actually would be obtained,&mdash;viz., A Cloud surcharged
with rain, and at a low distance from the
Earth, and on a calm day, could be compelled to
restore its stolen treasure, without waiting for its own
period of honesty! This could be done by <em>artificial</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
means, yet the living <em>cause</em> would be that of <em>Nature</em>
and her laws,&mdash;viz., by <em>heat</em>. As thus,&mdash;if beneath
that Rain-Cloud should be erected combustible matter
covering a large extent; and upon being ignited the
gathered heat <em>should reach that cloud</em>,&mdash;as a necessity,
the heavier cold air within, and around, that mass of
vapour, would descend towards the partial vacuum occasioned
by the heat,&mdash;with more or less speed according
to the intensity,&mdash;and thence discharge the accumulated
particles of rain upon the flame!</p>

<p>In following out the above train of reasoning, another
secret is unveiled,&mdash;viz., During the dreadful Conflagrations
of Cities and Capitals,&mdash;of Forests or Prairies,&mdash;it is
almost invariably recorded, that the light wind increased
to a breeze,&mdash;from that to a gale, or hurricane, and
perhaps from a friendly quarter,&mdash;or that the Rain
descended in torrents, and so Providentially extinguished
the fierce fury of the flaming element:&mdash;in
both these cases they were indeed Providential, for
they were based upon the undeviating laws of <em>cause</em>
and <em>effect</em>,&mdash;of <span class="smcap">God</span> and <em>Nature</em>! By thus tracing
the second principle (for it has its own results) to the
first, how much is Religious veneration increased, when
reflecting upon The Great Cause of the entire Universe!&mdash;The
<em>effects</em> then appear but as the sparkling
atoms of His ever brilliant Glory,&mdash;and the myriad
of Worlds the mere witnesses of His infinite Power!</p>

<p>We have digressed,&mdash;we were never yet upon a
happy path, or pursuit, that we did not wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
follow it out,&mdash;for true happiness is found only in the
walks of wisdom.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be proper to state, that the Orient
Gale is mentioned in various parts of Scripture, and
especially by the following inspired writers,&mdash;viz.,
<span class="smcap">Moses</span> [Exodus x. 13.&mdash;xiv. 21.] <span class="smcap">David</span> [Psalms
xlviii. 7.] <span class="smcap">Hosea</span> [xiii. 15.] <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> [xviii. 17.]
and by <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> [xvii. 10.&mdash;xix. 12.&mdash;xxvii. 26.]</p>

<p>The great miracles of the plague of Locusts,&mdash;and
the Passage of the Red Sea, were both carried into
effect by the instrumentality of this celebrated Wind.</p>

<p>"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land
of Egypt, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> brought an <em>East-wind</em> upon
the land all that day, and all that night: and when
it was morning <em>the East-wind</em> brought the locusts."</p>

<p>"And Moses stretched out his hand over the Sea:
and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> caused the Sea to go back by <em>a strong
East-wind</em> all that night, and made the Sea dry land,
and the waters were divided."</p>

<p>"Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with <em>an East-wind</em>."</p>

<p>"Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an
<em>East-wind</em> shall come, the wind of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall come
up from the <em>wilderness</em>, and his spring shall become
dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil
the treasure of all pleasant vessels."</p>

<p>"I will scatter them as with <em>an East-wind</em> before
the enemy: I will shew the back and not the face, in
the day of their calamity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yea, behold, being planted shall it prosper? Shall
it not utterly wither when the <em>East-wind</em> toucheth it?
It shall wither in the furrows where it grew."</p>

<p>"But she was plucked up in <em>fury</em>, she was cast
down to the ground, and the <em>East-wind</em> dried up her
fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered, the
fire consumed them."</p>

<p>Another quotation from <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> is reserved for the
next Section, to illustrate the Expedition.</p>

<p>In the Book of <span class="smcap">Jonah</span>, the very <em>cause</em> of the East-Wind
(<em>i. e.</em> <em>heat</em>) is given by the Prophet of Nineveh,&mdash;not
given as an explanation, but as an attendant
fact,&mdash;after 2700 years Science gives the former,
by an application of the fact, and thus establishes another
proof of the truth of Scriptural record.</p>

<p>"And it came to pass, when the <em>Sun did arise</em>, that
<span class="smcap">God</span> prepared <em>a vehement East-wind</em>: and <em>the Sun</em>
beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and
wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to
die than to live." [iv. 8.]</p>

<p>Presuming that this branch of our subject has been
sufficiently explained,&mdash;a slight review of the Tyrian
vessels will be required, for the purpose of ascertaining
whether they were of sufficient size and strength to
endure this voyage around the Continent of Africa;
and at a later period to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
One examination will answer for both questions.</p>

<p>The Tyrians had two species of large vessels. The
earliest were the <em>Gauli</em>, so called from being nearly
round, and used for coasting purposes, between Tyrus
and the neighbouring ports,&mdash;this species of Galley had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
a sail and a few oars. The superior vessels for long
voyages were Galleys of a much larger class, and
oblong in shape,&mdash;they had one, two, or three banks
of oars, in addition to one or two very large square-sails.
The <em>rows</em> of oarsmen (hence the name of <em>rowers</em> to this
time, although the mode of working has passed away)
were so placed on their banks or seats, as to be all
seen by the officer of the deck,&mdash;for the centre of the
Galley was open down nearly to the ballast. They
all kept time, and moved together, by watching the
action of the officer (at the stern of the vessel) having
the command of the rowers,&mdash;or by <em>singing</em>,&mdash;hence,
we apprehend, arose the marine name,&mdash;Mer-chants,
<em>i. e.</em> Singers of the Sea,&mdash;for the name is first applied
in Scripture to the Tyrians.</p>

<p>It has already been shewn that a Tyrian navy was
built for King <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> nearly four hundred years before
this period, and that it returned from India in
safety. Of the size of those vessels there is no record;
but from the character of the Voyage, conclusions may
be formed, as also of those employed in the Expedition
now under consideration. From the following data a
satisfactory deduction will be obtained: viz.&mdash;The
Galley in which <span class="smcap">St. Paul</span> embarked at his reshipment,
and that, too, belonging to the Tyrian side of
the Mediterranean, contained two hundred and seventy-six
human beings,&mdash;consequently it was from 400 to
500 tons burden. "And we were in all, in the ship,
two hundred, three score, and sixteen souls." [Acts
xxvii. 37.]</p>

<p>The Tyrian Galleys, as we have shewn, had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
only large sails, but many Rowers,&mdash;so that calm
weather was no hindrance to their progress. The
"hundred oars" took the place of Steam, as now employed
upon the Ocean, to be used in all weathers, and
consequently independent of the sail,&mdash;the latter being
used as the wind would permit. The Sail was generally
employed only before the wind, or slightly on the
quarter,&mdash;otherwise the pressure of the wind upon the
sail would heave one side of the vessel down, and consequently
drown the oars, while the opposite rowers
would be useless, from their oars being out of water.
The great force with which the ancient rowers could
propel their Galleys, may be gathered from the naval
engagement of Salamis (the "Nile" of the Greeks),
where their prow-beaks were driven into the sides of
the Persian vessels,&mdash;and thus grappled, they boarded
the invaders, and fought hand to hand; while many
of the Persian Galleys were run down, and instantly
sunk by the force and impetuosity of the Rowers, who,
be it remembered, were like the Tyrians, not "<em>slaves</em>
at the oar," but the <em>freemen</em> of their respective nations.</p>

<p>The vessels were also capacitated to carry sufficient
provisions for long voyages; and in this Expedition,
which was to circumnavigate the Continent of Africa,
the Tyrians would consequently keep in sight of land,&mdash;for
by <em>coasting</em> only, could their peculiar object be
accomplished; and therefore the food to be obtained
by fishing (their favourite pursuit) near the shores
would alone have been ample. Fresh water, also, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the coasting character of the voyage, would be always
within their reach.</p>

<p>Thus it has been shewn that the Pilots and Mariners
were competent, the Galleys capacious, strong,
and swift, and provisions and water abundant. The
King of Egypt had wished for the expedition; Eth-baal
of Tyrus, had furnished the material; both
Monarchs threw into the scale of inclination the
weight of their wealth and power; and in the indomitable
pride of the Tyrians was the security that it
would be accomplished. Herodotus states, that it was
successful. His assertion is not <em>denied</em> by any Historian,
and from what has been quoted in regard to his
accuracy, it cannot be impeached. We shall now proceed
to a description of the Voyage, and the production
of additional proofs,&mdash;the supposed track of the expedition,
and the discoveries,&mdash;and for convenience of reference,
modern terms will be generally employed.</p>


<h3>SECTION III.</h3>

<h4>THE EXPEDITION, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>As in the delineation of this celebrated Voyage, the
East-Wind will be alluded to; the reader will bear in
mind its locality upon the diurnal hemisphere,&mdash;viz.:
extending to 30 degrees North and South of the Equator.
Now, in consulting the Map, it will be found that
30 degrees North passes directly through Suez, at the
extreme North-East point of the Red Sea. From
this place then (Suez), it is probable that the Tyrians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
hoisted sail and plied their oars. They therefore commenced
the Voyage under the minor influence of this
Easterly Wind.</p>

<p>609 <small>B. C.</small>] They begun their Voyage, therefore, by
leaving Suez; and sailing along the shores of the Red
Sea, and through the Straits of Babelmandeb, they
doubled Cape Guardatoy, passing between that point
and the Island of Socatra. This Isle (subsequently
hallowed by the foot of <span class="smcap">St. Thomas</span>) was probably
seen by the Tyrians ages before, during the various
voyages of their ancestors to India and Ceylon. The
present adventurers, however, had now entered a new
track, and hugging the Eastern shore of Africa, coasted
past the lands of Adel and Ajan, and so to the Equator
of the Indian Ocean. Having crossed the equinoctial
line, they reached the first river of importance, the
Zebe; and near to <em>Melinda</em>, they must have observed
the "incident" of Nature, and have had every feeling
of awe and superstition aroused at the sight. Herodotus
was so much surprised when he first heard of it,
that it caused the only doubt in his mind concerning
the Voyage: but it was seen by the Tyrians,
and is visible at this day, and has been from Creation's
dawn, and will be for ever! This will be
explained as we proceed. Following the coast of
Zanzibar, they passed through the Channel of Mozambique,
the now inner passage to India from
America and Europe. Leaving the Island of Madagascar
on the left, they reached Port Natal. At
this point is the termination of 30 degrees South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
latitude on the <em>Indian</em> Ocean; having sailed in all from
Suez, 60 degrees of latitude. Now during this part
of the Expedition, the East-Wind had blown them <em>towards
the land</em>, and so favoured their enterprise, which
was commenced for the purpose of <em>coasting</em> the African
Continent, and consequently they would use every endeavour
to keep the land in sight,&mdash;to Port Natal,
Nature had befriended them. Continuing on 10 degrees
of Southern latitude, they reached the Cape of
Good Hope. Here the constant wind, which had accompanied
them as a friendly convoy from Suez to
Natal, now deserted them, and the fierce currents of
air rushed as enemies from every quarter to oppose
their further progress; and terrible indeed must have
been the passing of that stormy Cape to mariners for
the first time; they had no previous report of the dangers,
but had to meet the foe, as it were, in ambush,&mdash;they
had no North-Star or Compass to guide them,&mdash;their
astro-beacons upon the Mediterranean had been
the <em>Ursa</em> Constellations; but even those, perhaps, were
now obscured by their locality, or by the rising and
gathering storm-clouds.</p>

<p>608 <small>B. C.</small>] Having doubled the Cape of Good
Hope (probably at the end of the first year) and sailing
northward along the western coast of Africa 10
degrees towards the Equator, brought them to the
minor river of Namquois,&mdash;at this point is the thirty
degrees of South latitude on the <em>Atlantic</em> ocean, and
the commencement of the East-Wind blowing <em>from</em>
Africa, and with much greater force than from the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Ocean <em>towards</em> Africa, and for the reason previously
stated, viz., that both the Sun and the hot sands
of the Desert join their united powers in producing the
fierce air-currents,&mdash;and consequently this strong wind
thus blowing from Africa, has a direct tendency to drift
vessels from the coasting of the shores into the broad
Atlantic,&mdash;and in the present case of the Tyrians, they
would have to struggle continually against the power
of this East-Wind to keep in sight of land; it was accomplished
only by the skill and strength of the Rowers,
and this was especially required when they reached the
Equator at the Gulf of Guinea,&mdash;for here without
doubt they encountered the terrific effects of the Equinoctial
hurricanes;&mdash;all their skill and courage were now
demanded,&mdash;their Rowers had reached the broad and
raging waters of untracked seas,&mdash;here their fleet may
have sundered, and many a galley have been dismasted,
or "broken," and so foundered. We believe
that this was the case at this point of their Voyage, for
in the words of the Prophet <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>, who (as will be
proved) was speaking of this Expedition by the
Tyrians, and of the peculiar Wind causing these disasters,&mdash;not
spoken as a Prophecy, but as a cause accomplishing
the disasters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thy Rowers <em>have</em> brought thee (Tyrus) into <em>great
waters</em>: the <em>East-wind</em> <small>HATH</small> <em>broken thee in the midst
of the Seas</em>!"</p>

<p>If at this period they had had <em>sails</em> only, they
would have been cast abroad upon the Atlantic Ocean,
and so have been driven to America;&mdash;but we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
not avail ourselves of a <em>possibility</em>, when we are possessed
of a <em>probability</em> and <em>truth</em> as to the cause and
means of their reaching the Western Hemisphere,
which the subsequent pages will, (we believe) prove
and establish. In this voyage their object was apparent,
and upon losing masts and sails, still the power of the
Rowers would accomplish that object,&mdash;viz., of coasting
the African shores, and consequently prevent the
drifting of a Galley to America. Their determination
was to reach that home where their king and countrymen
were waiting with open arms to receive the adventurous
"spirits of the vasty deep,"&mdash;Egypt, also, was
waiting to give her welcome, and to announce the victory
of Science. We are anxious to destroy even any
apparent possibility (however remote) of their reaching
the Western Hemisphere during this voyage. We
desire this History to rest upon the more lasting basis
of strong and apparent truth and probability,&mdash;but,
even if a Galley had drifted across the Atlantic, an
absolute <em>cause</em> exists against even the <em>possibility</em> of
their <em>populating</em> America at this time. Of this hereafter,&mdash;if
the ingenious reader has not already guessed
the reason.</p>

<p>Having escaped from the hurricanes of the Equator,
and having "crossed the line," the, to them, phenomenon
of Nature again appeared, but in a different
aspect, exciting again their fears and alarm,&mdash;yet mingled
with recovering joy, for it appeared the same as
when they, at Tyrus, gazed upon the rising Sun, and
knelt in prayer to the Apollo of their ancestors! We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
will not anticipate this "phenomenon," although the
ingenuity of the reader may&mdash;we retain it for our
final proof that this Expedition was accomplished.</p>

<p>Having passed the Equator they followed the Gold
and Ivory coasts,&mdash;doubled the Capes Palmas and
Verd,&mdash;passing between the latter and the Island of
the same name,&mdash;doubled Capes Blanco and Barbas,&mdash;and
having reached nearly thirty degrees of North
latitude they must have seen with some astonishment
a snow-crowned peak, rising like a sparkling Pharos of
the Ocean. They could not (within the scope of probability)
have passed between it and the Continent and
not have seen it, as they must have been several days
in reaching the base of so elevated a land-beacon; and
having witnessed so conspicuous an object they would
not pass without landing. The ocean and silver-crested
giant attracting the attention of the Tyrians,
was the now renowned Peak of Teneriffe, upon the
Island of the name; and forming the principal of a
group of thirteen, now called the Canaries, but known
in ancient geography as the Fortunate Isles. They
are all within the thirty degrees of North latitude, and
consequently within the influence of the East-Wind.
This fact is of importance, and will again be brought
forward,&mdash;we mention this to impress the fact upon
the mind of the reader.</p>

<p>The Tyrians in all probability landed at Teneriffe,&mdash;"replenished,"
refitted, and repaired all damages, for a
continuation of the voyage;&mdash;of its remaining distance
as yet they could have no intelligence. They were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
however, within ten degrees of the Herculean Gates of
that Sea, which their fellow-countrymen claimed to be
their own! As the entire expedition occupied three
years in its accomplishment they probably landed at the
Isle of Teneriffe in about two and a half years from
the time of their leaving Suez. [606&frac12; <small>B. C.</small>]</p>

<p>It appears certain that none of the Tyrians would
leave the Galleys for the purpose of becoming the Aborigines
of the Island at this time,&mdash;for they knew not of
the future dangers of the voyage, therefore "all hands"
were required. Again,&mdash;the peculiar character of the
Expedition would not permit it,&mdash;and having been so
long from their native land, together with the pride of
receiving the National applause attendant upon their
Nautical triumph,&mdash;would be against any supposition
that the Tyrians would remain from choice, or as exiles
and outcasts. This slight review of the apparent impossibility
of any of the voyagers remaining upon the
Islands after the departure of the Galleys, is required
in order to establish in the future pages, when the
Ph&oelig;nicians did land and dwell there, and so account
for the ancient Mummies found at this day in the rocky
caverns of Teneriffe;&mdash;and of which, allusion and comparisons
have been made, in investigating the Tyrian
and Mexican analogies. [Vol. i., Book i., ch. vii., § 4.]
We considered it established, therefore, that no settled
residence would take place at any period of this Expedition:
and apart from all other reasons, there is one
that would render it absolutely impossible,&mdash;viz., They
had not with them that lovely portion of Nature, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
which life itself is but a desert Isle or a desolation,&mdash;viz.,
<em>Woman</em>! This fact, also, produced an incontrovertible
argument against even the <em>possibility</em> (as before
hinted) that the foundations of the Aboriginal family
were laid in Ancient America during any period of this
Expedition. This part of the argument must appear
to every reader as irrefragable. The custom of not
permitting the Wives to accompany the mariners, and
especially on a Voyage of Discovery, is practised even
at this day. This arises not only from physical reasons,
but from mental causes;&mdash;for in the hour of storm or
wreck, the courage of the mariner would be divided
from his duty, remembering that his affections were in
danger; and in contemplating the proverbial solicitude
and devotion of Woman, for the safety of her husband
or her child, he would be compelled to turn from the
general rescue, to aid her resolution, and selfishly
(though naturally) confront danger for themselves alone.</p>

<p>By thus proving the impossibility of Ancient America
having been founded during this Expedition, and for the
above reason,&mdash;we bring down upon ourselves the responsibility
of proving, that when the Western Continent
was first reached, <em>Women were the associates of the
Voyage</em>! We bring this proposition forward for the
purpose of proving to the reader, that it is not intended
to establish this Romance of Time (<em>i. e.</em> Truth)
upon idle or visionary grounds.</p>

<p>The group of Islands now left by the Tyrians were
of a character, from their locality and natural produce,
(and especially that one possessing the snow-crowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Peak,) not to be forgotten by the voyagers in relating
"the dangers they had passed."</p>

<p>They now coasted along the shores of Morocco and
Fez, and entering the Straits of Gibraltar, passed the
Pillars of Hercules, and floated on the waters of their
native Sea,&mdash;thus proving for the first time that the
boundary Columns of Alcides had been erected in vain;&mdash;and
also, that human ingenuity and perseverance
will conquer, and bear down all the barriers erected by
Superstition as the landmarks of human Intellect!</p>

<p>In their triumphant passage along the shores of the
Mediterranean, Carthage would not be passed unvisited
by the descendants of the same race, who had followed
the fortunes of a Tyrian Princess, when driven from
her own land by treachery and cruelty. Leaving the
Republic of Carthage, (in which commercial storehouse
they must have seen the germs of a future rival,) with
what pride and joy must they have reached the Delta
of the Nile?&mdash;and beyond those feelings, when Tyrus
was seen from the round-top of a galley-mast,&mdash;or
when from their native shore they received the united
voice of a gladdened nation?</p>

<p>Three years of danger and unyielding courage, upon
an extended field of Science, preserved the fame of
Egypt's King, and gave new and brilliant glory to the
Tyrians and their Sovereign.</p>

<p>Pharaoh-Necho had achieved his wish by the circumnavigation
of the Continent, of which Egypt was
the Capital, and this being the only object of the Egyptian,
all discoveries of Islands, as forming no part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
African Continent, would therefore be claimed by the
Tyrians as their own. The Fortunate Isles (<em>i. e.</em> Canaries)
for instance,&mdash;and consequently Ithobalus and his
successors, would be the rightful "Kings of those
Islands" discovered during this voyage, and situated
"beyond the Sea,"&mdash;and to be reached by passing
through the Gates of Gades,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Even if Pharaoh had claimed the Isles discovered, it
would have been useless, for he had no navy (if opposed
by Tyrus) to support that claim. It is not probable
that he would attempt it,&mdash;but even the supposition
is set at rest, for the King of Babylon conquered
Pharaoh-Necho and Egypt, only <em>seven years</em> after this
voyage, for compelling him to raise the first Siege of
Jerusalem. Pharaoh was receiving his annual tribute
from the Jews: Nebuchadnezzar, therefore, instantly
left Judæa and turned his warfare upon the Egyptians,
[599 <small>B. C.</small>] captured all the treasure of the Nile, and returned
triumphant to the Euphrates.</p>

<p>This Section will be concluded by producing the
authority of Scripture (with the incident of Nature) to
support the statement of Herodotus: and although the
Prophets will be quoted, in this instance Prophecy
itself has no bearing upon the subject,&mdash;their words
upon this direct investigation only refer to that <em>which
had taken place</em>, and consequently only of past record,
and not for predictions of a future. This was the
case with <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> and <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>, but,&mdash;<em>not with</em>
<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>,&mdash;and upon this fact do we rest the Scriptural
record of the successful accomplishment of this Voyage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Our argument is as follows,&mdash;viz., In the Prophecy by
<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> already quoted [Book ii., ch. v.] there is no
allusion whatever to this Expedition, and for the reason,&mdash;that
<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> wrote of the doom of Tyrus 106
years <em>before</em> the period of this Voyage,&mdash;consequently
the absence of all notice by this Sacred writer (the
subject not being prophetical) proves at least that the
naval enterprise was undertaken <em>after</em> the time in
which he prophecied the downfall of the Tyrian Nation:&mdash;Following
out this train of reasoning, any
Prophet, therefore, who came <em>after</em> the Expedition,
and in speaking, or writing, of Tyrus, <em>should allude to
it</em> as having taken place,&mdash;for it would form another
item in the gathered glory of Sidon's Daughter, and
would be included in that long list of pride about to
be cancelled by the Babylonian Conquest. The reader
will find that the later Prophets <em>did</em> allude to this
Voyage, and, also, to the cluster of Isles of which Teneriffe
is the principal.</p>

<p>The first of these is <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>, who prophesied the
destruction of several offending Nations, in the first
year of the reign of the King of Babylon, and the fourth
of Jehoiakim, Monarch of Judæa,&mdash;this was in the
beginning of the year 606 <small>B. C.</small> Now supposing that
the Voyagers left Suez in the commencement of the
year 609 <small>B. C.</small> and occupying three years in the enterprise,&mdash;would
bring the defined period to the end of
607 <small>B. C.</small>&mdash;consequently <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> wrote his words
<em>only a few Months</em> after the triumphant issue, and discovery
of "the Isles beyond the Sea,"&mdash;the account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
which would speed through Judæa and the surrounding
nations, as it had through Egypt and Tyrus. It is
a remarkable circumstance, that in tracing back the
history of this Voyage nearly 2500 years, that it should
be found to have been alluded to only a few months,&mdash;perhaps
weeks&mdash;after its accomplishment, and in the
sacred page of Scripture: and it is still more singular,
that writers upon this subject of record by Herodotus,
should have passed it unheeded; as, also, the allusion
by <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>.</p>

<p>The Prophecy by <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> concerning Judæa, as
well as of Tyrus, will be quoted in order to shew the
character of the approaching destruction. The last
lines contain the allusion mentioned, having reference
to the discovery of the Fortunate Isles.</p>

<p>"For thus said the Lord <span class="smcap">God</span> of Israel unto me,&mdash;Take
the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause
all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it: and
they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of
the sword that I will send among them. To wit,&mdash;Jerusalem
and the Cities of Judæa and the Kings
thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation,
an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse: as it
is at this day. <em>And all the Kings of Tyrus</em>, and all
the Kings of Sidon,&mdash;and <em>the Kings of the Isles which
are</em> <small>BEYOND</small> <em>the Sea</em>." [xxv.]</p>

<p>Now "<em>the Sea</em>" mentioned, means (as it does throughout
the Bible) the <em>Mediterranean</em>, and especially when
Tyrus is written of,&mdash;several proofs of this are found in
the Book of <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"It (Tyrus) shall be a place for the spreading of
nets in the midst of <em>the Sea</em>."</p>

<p>"Then all the princes of <em>the Sea</em> shall come down
from their thrones," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"How art thou destroyed, that was inhabited of
sea-faring men,&mdash;the renowned City,&mdash;which was strong
in <em>the Sea</em>," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Now shall the Isles tremble in the day of thy fall:
yea, the Isles that are <em>in</em> [not "beyond"] <em>the Sea</em>, shall
be troubled at thy <em>departure</em>."</p>

<p>When Pharaoh's fatal Sea is spoken of, it is called
by its name in full,&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> <em>The Red Sea</em>:&mdash;the Asphaltine
Sea covering the crime-smitten Cities of Sodom
and Gomorrah, is called <em>the Dead Sea</em>,&mdash;and so of
others,&mdash;but "<em>the Sea</em>" defines it to be the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The Islands referred to by <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> are stated to
be "<em>beyond the Sea</em>"&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> Isles beyond the mouth of
the Mediterranean, reached by passing through the
Straits of Gibraltar; and the language, therefore, alludes
distinctly to the Fortunate Isles discovered by
the Tyrians during the voyage. "The Kings of Tyrus"
were, also, by right of discovery the actual "Kings
of the Isles which are beyond the Sea." That these
are the Islands referred to, may be gathered from the
fact, that the last quotation from <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> proves that
the Isles of the Mediterranean are spoken of as being
"<em>in</em> the Sea," in direct contradistinction to those "<em>beyond</em>
the Sea." The same defined locality is found in
<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wherefore glorify ye the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in the fires [Hebrew,
"valleys"] even the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span> of
Israel, in the Isles <em>of the Sea</em>." [xxiv. 15.]</p>

<p>The Prophet here refers to Cyprus, Crete, Sicily, and
Sardinia, for these are "Isles <small>OF</small>" or "<small>IN</small>" the Mediterranean,&mdash;while
the Fortunatæ Insulæ are those denominated
"<em>beyond</em>" the same Sea,&mdash;Britain and Hibernia
were not yet discovered by the Tyrians;&mdash;and the
only Islands at this time known to them "<em>beyond</em>" the
<em>Mare Internum</em>, were those discovered during this
celebrated Expedition;&mdash;truly so, for being alluded to
by the Sacred writers, proves the importance attached
to it in the days of Prophecy. The Islands discovered,
and claimed by the Tyrians, were additional causes for
their fatal pride,&mdash;and are, therefore, the only part of
the enlarging Kingdom referred to by <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>,&mdash;from
the apparent fact, that the terrible prediction in
alluding to a recent geographical discovery, would
attract the instant attention, and arouse the fears of
the Judæans as well as the Tyrians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> uttered his celebrated Prophecy concerning
Tyrus 588 <small>B. C.</small>, consequently only <em>eighteen</em> years after
the Voyage. He should, therefore, allude to it, if our
previous argument is founded upon just grounds in
reference to <span class="smcap">Isaiah's</span> <em>not</em> writing of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> in issuing his malediction against Tyrus, its
King, Prince, and People, gathers in his catalogue of
their united powers all that had made them great, and
unrivalled among the nations of the earth. He commences
by stating their knowledge of Shipbuilding and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Navigation,&mdash;then the various Kingdoms receiving their
Commercial commodities, and the riches given in
return,&mdash;progressing in his description in apparent
chronological order,&mdash;for this singular fact is arrived
at,&mdash;viz., that the last verse referring to the deeds of
the Tyrians, covers distinctly this very Voyage,&mdash;and
which took place only 18 years before the Prophecy,
and was, therefore, probably their last great action,
before they were besieged and conquered by the King
of Babylon; and which event was only three years
after the prediction of <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>,&mdash;who, in alluding to
the last effort for fame by the Tyrians, and causing
additional pride of heart, says&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Thy</em> <small>ROWERS</small> <em>have brought thee</em> (Tyrus) <em>into</em>
<small>GREAT</small> <em>waters</em> [<em>i. e.</em> the Atlantic]&mdash;<em>the</em> <span class="smcap">East-Wind</span>
<em>hath broken thee in the midst of the</em> <span class="smcap">Seas</span>." [xxvii.]</p>

<p>The word "Sea" in the singular number, and without
any pre-nomen as <em>Dead Sea</em>, &amp;c., has already been
shewn, and from the same writer, to have direct reference
to the Mediterranean. In the above quotation he
evidently means larger, and collective bodies of "great
waters,"&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> <em>Seas</em>,&mdash;(plural).&mdash;Again,&mdash;In the same
chapter he writes:</p>

<p>"And thou wast replenished [at the Insulæ?] and
made very glorious in the midst of the <em>Seas</em>."</p>

<p>He even seems to define the boundary of Tyrus in
the Atlantic, for <em>Islands</em> are distinctly alluded to.</p>

<p>"Thy <em>borders</em> are in the <em>midst of the Seas</em>."</p>

<p>And as a distinct contrast of locality; he says of the
Capital of the Mediterranean,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>"What City is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the
midst of the <em>Sea</em>."</p>

<p>The Capital, at this time, was partly on the Island,
but principally on the mainland. It is submitted that
both <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> and <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> alluded to this Voyage
and its discoveries.</p>

<p>We have reserved a positive, a conclusive proof, of
the accomplishment of the Expedition until this time,
that it might remove all doubts upon the subject. It,
also, brings direct evidence against the supposition
that in reaching Ophir (the locality of which is not
yet defined) the Tyrian ships of <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> could have
passed around the Cape of Good Hope,&mdash;for if they
had,&mdash;leagues before they reached there, they would
have observed the same (to them) strange "incident" of
Nature, and consequently have recorded it.</p>

<p>Herodotus in writing of this Voyage (and which he
firmly believed) had his doubts upon one point only,&mdash;viz.,
the strange reports of the Pilots and Mariners
upon their return to Tyrus, which were,&mdash;that during
the Voyage their <span class="smcap">Shadows</span> (as they looked at the
Sun's rising) fell upon, or from their <em>right</em>-hand,&mdash;they
(the Shadows) having consequently <em>changed</em> from the
<em>left</em> hand, as they remembered them to fall at Ph&oelig;nicia
and the Mediterranean;&mdash;and a greater wonder
still,&mdash;that their Shadows changed back again, as they
continued their voyage, from right to left!</p>

<p>The Greek Historian viewed this report with astonishment
and disbelief; and without doubt, it was
originally regarded and laughed at as a mariner's story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
by both Tyrians and Egyptians,&mdash;for it was not likely,
in their Theory of the Solar System, (this was before
Pythagoras,) that any of the Ancients could be
convinced that the Sun would alter its course or nature,
so as to meet the result reported by the home-returned
mariners, but which was given by them as an attested
fact. The Ancients [606 <small>B. C.</small>] believed that the Earth
was a Globe, because they believed that the Sun daily
travelled <em>around</em> it,&mdash;but of the revolving character of
the Earth, or of its measurement, they had no conception.
Even Herodotus, therefore, looked upon the
shadow-report as</p>

<p class="center">
"The baseless fabric of a vision,"
</p>

<p>and regarded it not only with incredulity, but as an entire
fiction of the Tyrian voyagers.</p>

<p>But modern Science proves the absolute <em>truth</em> of the
Tyrian report,&mdash;viz., <em>their Shadows changing from left
to right</em>, &amp;c.; and this, as a necessity, was occasioned by
<em>their having crossed the line of the Equator</em>!</p>

<p>If the story of the Pilots and Mariners <em>had not</em> been
given to their countrymen upon their return, it would
at this day be a strong presumptive proof that the Expedition
was <em>not</em> accomplished; but having rendered
the "incident" of Nature upon their arrival, it is a
conclusive and undeniable proof that the Voyage was
successfully completed, and during the time mentioned
by Herodotus. Having sailed from the Red Sea, <em>and
crossed the line of the Equator</em>, and looking East, their
Shadows must have changed from left to right, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
be perceptible at, or near, Melinda; and having
doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and passed the Equator
of the Atlantic, their Shadows would again change
from right to left, near the Gulf of Guinea, and appear
the same as when sailing upon the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The statements of Herodotus concerning the "shifting
of the shadows," and the manner of "extracting the
brain" previous to Embalming; and with the foregone
proofs of their accuracy both from science and ocular demonstration,
are without their parallels for supporting the
authenticity of an Ancient Historian&mdash;and truly may he
be called the <em>Father</em> of History&mdash;for Nations were his
children, and justly he wrote of them. Time has
become his executor, and renders him ample justice
in return for his valuable legacy to posterity!</p>

<p>We have been anxious to establish the accomplishment
of this celebrated Voyage, the first mentioned
having reference to the circumnavigation of a Continent;&mdash;but,
more especially have we been solicitous to
prove that <em>the Fortunate Isles were known to the Tyrians
during this Expedition</em>;&mdash;for those Islands form
an important feature in the great event to follow. In
the endeavour to confirm these propositions, we have
pursued a path of research and reasoning, we believe,
untrodden, or attempted by any writer upon the subject.
The Greek Historian is supported by his own
accuracy of character and delineation,&mdash;and he is
directly confirmed by Holy-Writ. <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span> wrote
of it only a few months after the Expedition. <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>
18 years subsequently, and Herodotus 122 years after
the enterprise. The later (and jealous) Romans only
are silent:&mdash;<em>they do not deny it</em>,&mdash;which they would
naturally have done, if they would not also have been
liable to have been contradicted.</p>

<p>We now submit the subject to the reader's opinion,
upon a review of the evidence, facts, and reasoning
upon the entire proposition; and shall proceed with
the History of Tyrus and the Migration, in the belief
that the decision is in the affirmative;&mdash;and that consequently
<em>the Fortunate Isles</em> (<em>i. e.</em> the Canaries) are
admitted to have been discovered, and claimed, by
the Tyrians during this first great Voyage around the
Continent of Africa, and between the years 609-606
before the Christian Æra; and that from the <em>natural</em>
reason stated,&mdash;viz., the absence of Woman&mdash;the
Founding of Ancient America could not have taken
place at that time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>(585&mdash;515 <small>B. C.</small>)</h3>

<p class="center">ITHOBALUS THE SECOND&mdash;TO SISINNES.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">THE FIRST SIEGE OF TYRUS, &amp;c.&mdash;FULFILMENT OF THE
PROPHECY BY JEREMIAH AND EZEKIEL,&mdash;AND OF THE
FIRST AND SECOND PROPHECY BY ISAIAH.</p></blockquote>


<p>During the war upon Egypt by the King of Babylon,
(and which occurred only seven years after the Voyage
around Africa,) it is probable that the King of Tyrus
would assist Pharaoh-Necho against the invasion of the
Nile by Nebuchadnezzar. The attack by Pharaoh, at
the solicitation of Judæa [Ezekiel xvii. 15], (which nation
was still paying the annual tribute to Egypt,) had
compelled the Babylonian to raise the siege of Jerusalem:&mdash;in
this movement, also, the Tyrians may have
aided by countenance or wealth. In these apparent
probabilities, we find the <em>political</em> cause why Nebuchadnezzar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
turned his fury upon Tyrus, after his conquest
of Egypt, and his second and successful invasion
of Judæa, and the captivity of the Jews,&mdash;which latter
event took place 588 <small>B. C.</small></p>

<p>The fall of Judæa gave the monopolizing and pride-stricken
Tyrians great cause for rejoicing,&mdash;not from
malice against the afflicted People,&mdash;but because their
own <em>Trading</em> propensities would be increased,&mdash;as it
would (in their minds) by the downfall of any aspiring
Nation. A few years before they had witnessed the
conquest of Egypt,&mdash;and now of Judæa,&mdash;both of which
were causes of peculiar joy to the Tyrians; for those
Nations had latent sparks within them, from which the
fire of Science might be created, and so illumine their
own path towards the attainment of Navigation, and
thence rest upon their own exertions for Commercial
prosperity. Jerusalem had evinced this spirit as early
as the time of <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>,&mdash;and also Egypt, only seven
years before her present downfall. This was the point
causing the National rejoicing of Tyrus;&mdash;it was a Commercial
gladness,&mdash;thence (with them) a <em>political</em> one:&mdash;less
rejoicing, or its entire absence, would have been
"love of neighbour,"&mdash;and which, when it affected their
interest, the Tyrians never had;&mdash;extended joy,&mdash;as if
Jerusalem had fallen for the express purpose of their
own prosperity, and so sanctioned by their Gods,&mdash;became
blasphemy! They evinced this impiety to its
full extent;&mdash;therefore, the King of Babylon, in resenting
his own wrongs, was but an instrument of retribution
in the hand of <span class="smcap">God</span>, to punish those, who in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
savage triumph rejoiced at the chastening, and captivity
of a neighbour-Nation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> thus describes the <em>Religious</em> cause why
Tyrus (in her want of charity to a fallen neighbour)
should become desolate. [xxvi.] He prophesied, 588 <small>B. C.</small>,</p>

<p>"The word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came unto me, saying, Son
of Man, <em>because</em> that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem,
'Aha! she is broken that was the gates of
the People: she is turned unto <em>me</em>; I shall be replenished,
now <em>she</em> is laid waste!'"&mdash;</p>

<p>The Prince of Tyrus, also, uttered this blasphemy in
his triumph:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am a God! I sit in the seat of God!" [xxviii.]</p>

<p>"Therefore," continues <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>, "thus saith the
<span class="smcap">Lord God</span>: Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and
will cause many Nations to come up against thee, as
the Sea causeth his waves to come up. And they
shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her
towers: I will scrape her dust from her and make her
like the top of a rock. <em>It shall be a place for the
spreading of nets in the midst of the Sea</em>; [how truly
fulfilled!] for I have spoken it, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span>:
and it shall become a spoil to the Nations. And her
daughters which are in the field shall be slain with the
sword; and they shall know that I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. For
thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span>:&mdash;Behold I will bring upon
Tyrus Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, a King of
Kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots,
and with horsemen, and companies, and much
people," &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>The remaining part of the Prophecy is not required,&mdash;the
cause is shewn,&mdash;the punishment and the
avenger. The Prophecy was uttered by <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> in
the year in which Jerusalem was destroyed (the Temple
of which the Tyrians of a former age had erected
and adorned), and consequently three years before the
commencement of the Siege of Tyrus by the Babylonian.
The doom of Tyrus was also foretold by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>
and <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>; and by the former, that the Nation
should cease for <em>seventy years</em>. He prophesied one
hundred and twenty-seven years, and <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> twenty-one
years before the Siege by the King of Babylon. It
was strictly fulfilled. The investment commenced in
the reign of Ithobalus [<em>i. e.</em> Eth-baal] the Second,
and lasted <em>thirteen</em> years&mdash;the longest Siege on record.
Troy was only <em>ten</em>; the Roman Siege of Veii, by Camillus,
occupied the same period.</p>

<p>It has already been shewn, upon the authority of
<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> and <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>, that the <em>Island</em> of Tyrus must
have been partly inhabited, for they distinctly allude
to the "Isle." The metropolis proper, with its Temples
and splendour, was on the mainland,&mdash;and this
was the <em>City</em> besieged by the Conqueror of Egypt and
Judæa. The Island he could not reach from the want of
Galleys; his force consisting of Chariots, Cavalry, and
Infantry. It was impossible, therefore, to take Tyrus
(one side being on the Sea) as he had captured Jerusalem,
through the terrific means of Famine,&mdash;the
horrors of which are so powerfully depicted in the Lamentations
of <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>; and in reference to Judæa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
foretold by the first Lawgiver nearly nine centuries before!</p>

<p>The Tyrians, through the means of their shipping,
continually supplied the Capital with provisions,&mdash;thence
the duration of the Siege, and Nebuchadnezzar
had not the genius of the subsequent and final Conqueror
of Tyrus&mdash;the heroic Macedonian.</p>

<p>The Babylonian had therefore to erect his forts and
mounds, and with his engines of war make a breach into
the mainland City. During the several years, thousands
were slain on either side; those of the Tyrians were
replaced by her "wise-men" of the Ocean,&mdash;her pilots
and mariners; and as they left their vessels for the Metropolis,
the Galleys were sunk at Sea to prevent their
falling into the enemy's hands, and thereby enable them
to turn upon the Island, the only place of Tyrian retreat.
After a Siege of thirteen years, and more than three-quarters
of the male population destroyed, breaches
were made in the walls,&mdash;for men were no longer there
to defend them,&mdash;the Metropolis was entered by the
foe, and every part destroyed; Temples, Palaces, and
houses laid in ashes, or razed to the ground, and the
inhabitants slain, excepting those that had fled to the
Island. These consisted principally of Women and
Children; and to the rescue of the great proportion of
the former, and thus preventing Rapine and Slaughter
by the besiegers, may reasonably be attributed the
cause of the rapid increase of the Tyrian population
upon the <em>Island</em>, and which has always confounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
writers upon this Siege, and led some to doubt the fulfilment
of the Prophecy.</p>

<p>The Babylonian could not reach these fugitives for
the reason stated,&mdash;viz., the want of navigable means.
And besides, the Metropolis was destroyed, and that
was his intent; and that accomplished, he would be
willing to receive a tributary capitulation from the
Islanders. In the course of the Siege, the King of
Tyrus died, and also the Prince. [These deaths were
prophesied by <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>.] The Tyrian Monarch was
succeeded by Baal, a branch of the Royal House.
Nebuchadnezzar finding that the Island could not be
subdued [572 <small>B. C.</small>], offered terms to Baal,&mdash;they were
accepted, and Baal was appointed his tributary Viceroy,
and remained the vassal king of Tyrus for ten
years, and died 562 <small>B. C.</small> The shadowy dignity of
Viceroy was then abolished, and Magistrates were appointed
to administer Justice, and preside over the
affairs of State. This Magisterial Government continued
only for six years, when it was abolished, and
the Sovereignty restored in the person of Balator,
but still depending on the Assyrian Monarch for all
power and authority. [556 <small>B. C.</small>] This vassalage of the
Tyrians was continued to the time of Sisinnes, regal
governor of Ph&oelig;nicia, who, by the command of Darius,
King of Babylon, assisted by the Tyrians, materially
aided in building the <em>Second</em> Temple of
Jerusalem, upon the restoration of the House of
Judah; and in the same spirit as Hiram the Great
aided Solomon king of Israel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>515 <small>B. C.</small>] The Second Temple was finished and
dedicated in the year 515 before Christ. Now taking
the Prophecy of <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, to commence at the <em>beginning</em>
of the Siege of Tyrus (for Tyrus had then ceased to
be free, <em>i. e.</em> as a Nation), which was in 585 <small>B. C.</small>, the
"seventy years" will be <em>exactly accomplished</em> at the
dedication of the Second Temple.</p>

<p>Thus were the first and second Prophecies by
<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> fulfilled,&mdash;viz., the fall and subsequent freedom,&mdash;for
the destruction did take place, and at the termination
of "seventy years" the Lord of Mercy <em>did</em>
"visit Tyrus," and made her again a Nation;&mdash;for her
scorn and boast upon the destruction of Jerusalem had
been forgotten and forgiven, in her stretching forth her
hand again to aid the building of the Sacred Temple
to The One and Only <span class="smcap">God</span>!</p>

<p>As an instance of Divine Justice, it may be observed,
that the freedom of Tyrus did not take place
<em>before</em> the restoration of Judæa,&mdash;and that the former
nation had to endure the remorse of knowing that the
latter from her new throne of liberty, could behold
the manacles of thraldom upon that country, which
(in prosperity) had shouted in impious triumph upon
<em>her</em> desolation!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII:</h2>

<h3>(515&mdash;335 <small>B. C.</small>)</h3>

<p class="center">SISINNES TO STRATO.</p>

<p class="center">AND FROM THE FIRST TYRIAN REVOLUTION TO AZELMIC.
</p>


<p>At the termination of the siege by Nebuchadnezzar,
we have stated, that the remaining Tyrians fled to the
Island, opposite to the ancient metropolis destroyed by
the Babylonian. The inhabitants never rebuilt the
Capital upon the ruins on the mainland, but upon the
Island which had received and sheltered them, they had
for the last half-century turned all their attention;&mdash;this
was now renewed with redoubled energy,&mdash;upon
it they erected their new, and in time, gorgeous
Temples,&mdash;especially that dedicated to Hercules-Apollo,
the tutelary God of the Tyrians. They also
surrounded the Island with a sea-wall, 150 feet in
height, and of proportionate thickness,&mdash;and from
there being no approach to it but by water, the new
metropolis was considered impregnable. Upon the
mainland they erected many buildings of a minor
character, such as are usually found in the environs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
a City;&mdash;and a great proportion of the labouring
classes dwelt there; as, also, the strangers visiting
Tyrus in pursuit of traffic or merchandise. Many
years were employed in bringing the Island-Capital to
a state of complete defence, owing to the diminished
numbers of the male population immediately after the
siege. Tyrus must now be viewed as only on the
<em>Island</em>, which was about 800 yards from the shore,&mdash;somewhat
less than half a mile.</p>

<p>From the time of Sisinnes the Nation continued to
increase in wealth and power. The former cause of
her pride and glory&mdash;Navigation&mdash;was revived
with all the energy and perseverance for which
their ancestors in the time of Hiram had been so
justly renowned. As in her days of ancient fame,
Tyrus had loaned and built fleets and navies for Israel
and Egypt, she now did the same for the Persian
Monarch in his war upon Greece. A double motive
caused this,&mdash;not only the pride of being able to furnish
a navy, but her spirit of monopoly had again
risen, and begun to stalk abroad,&mdash;for Greece had
already aroused the jealousy of the Tyrians, and
any means to crush or destroy the harbour of the
Peiræus, would advance their wishes. From the Persian
they could entertain no fears of commercial rivalry,
for he had no river or port upon the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The honour of Tyrus, as a Nation, however, was
shewn in refusing to loan or man a navy, intended by
a foreign king (who at first concealed his intent) for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
carrying on a war against Carthage, and which denial
led to the abandonment of the proposed warfare. It
will be remembered that Carthage was originally
founded by a Tyrian Princess and her countrymen.
The Patriotism of the Tyrians was as powerful as their
knowledge of Science was universal.</p>

<p>For thirty-five years Tyrus enjoyed the freedom of
an independent nation, when all Ph&oelig;nicia was laid
under contribution by the Monarch of Persia:&mdash;He was
content, however, with a mere nominal tribute from
the Tyrians in return for their aid against the Greeks,&mdash;and
perhaps from a distant belief that that assistance
might again be required. In furtherance of this
design or policy, he did not depose the reigning king,
but recognised in him the exercise of full powers (except
the tribute) as a monarch of an independent
nation.</p>

<p>480 <small>B. C.</small>] This nominal tribute was during the
reign of Marten. The king and nobles were willing to
flatter the vanity of the Persian by the nominal payment,
for by his forbearance from any further action
against the Islanders, it enabled them to increase their
power, and retain their "places" both at home and
abroad;&mdash;they, therefore, could well afford to spare
from their rich and overflowing treasury of Pride, so
small a portion of a superfluity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zechariah</span> wrote [ch. ix.] "And Tyrus did build
herself a strong hold [the Island-Citadel], and heaped
up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the
street;"&mdash;but her Pride was as subtle, "as broad and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
general as the casing air,"&mdash;it was in and around her,&mdash;it
was her nature,&mdash;to have been otherwise would
have destroyed her identity and nationality. It was,
however, upon one occasion, exerted as a noble spirit,
and atoned for her errors past,&mdash;it proved that Freedom
was not dead within the walls of Tyrus;&mdash;and
the now noble exertion of the only Pride justifiable in
any country,&mdash;that of National Freedom,&mdash;led to the
first and only Revolution in the annals of the Tyrians
in Asia. [475 <small>B. C.</small>]</p>

<p>Justin states that it was an insurrection among the
<em>Slaves</em>! We do not presume to contradict the record
of any Historian, but would rather use every effort to
support their statements by facts and evidence, as in
the instance of Herodotus concerning the first Voyage
around Africa;&mdash;but the record of Justin cannot be
founded in truth, so far as relates to the supposed class
of human beings rising against their Monarch and his
Council. Tyrus had no <em>Slaves</em>, in the usual acceptation
of the word,&mdash;for she had no foreign conquests,&mdash;and
her subjects were too proud to allow of any but
themselves to pilot or man their galleys,&mdash;either for
merchandise or warfare;&mdash;nor would she allow foreigners
to live within her walls, especially of the
lower ranks of life, lest they should obtain the secret
of ship-building, and so convey intelligence to other
nations bordering upon the Mediterranean. But ancient
writers have generally viewed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tiers état</i>,&mdash;or
the third class of despotic Empires and Kingdoms as
<em>Slaves</em>, and so have written of them. Even to so late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
a period as half a century ago, the same was done in
France, till her Revolution (although it moved in
blood and tyranny, and brought to light human-monsters)
established that the People were to enjoy rights
and liberties; in analogy with those claimed and exercised
by the Islanders of Britain, or their descendants
in the Western Hemisphere. The great National lesson
was first taught the World by the Rebellion of the
Patriot,&mdash;Jeroboam, and the Ten Tribes,&mdash;from the
"whip" and "scorpion" Son of Solomon!</p>

<p>The Rebellion of Jeroboam was but 500 years before
this period, [475 <small>B. C.</small>] and from the great intercourse
between the Judæans and Tyrians, the event must
have been familiar to the latter, and may have had its
natural influence, therefore, in forwarding a similar
action of their own.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that the People disapproved
of the payment of the nominal tribute (which was
more degrading than any other), and made a remonstrance
to the Throne upon the subject,&mdash;for their just
pride had been aroused, and while they continued to
pay to the Persian for mere political existence, they
<em>ceased</em> to be a Nation of <em>Freemen</em>,&mdash;and Justin might
consequently have written that <em>all</em> the Tyrians,&mdash;King,
Nobles, and People, were <em>Slaves</em>,&mdash;for they were so,
while their golden manacles rattled, and echoed along
the distant shores of the Euphrates. Tyrus was, also,
safe now from any attack by land,&mdash;and by water the
Capital defied apparently both man and elements.
The tribute had been originally imposed and levied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
upon the National weakness,&mdash;it was now to be thrown
off in its day of strength. The King who would cowardly
surrender, and continue to submit a Nation's
liberty to a foreign yoke, while he had power to be
free,&mdash;and yet was willing to wear and hold the mere
shadows of a Crown and Sceptre,&mdash;must have been, at
heart, no fit guardian, or steward, of a People's honour
or prosperity;&mdash;and especially, when in the very rank
of life, the rights of which he continued to betray,&mdash;there
was a Spirit&mdash;like the Sun&mdash;ready to disperse
the clouds lowering upon, and obscuring his Country's
freedom! This Tyrian Patriot was <span class="smcap">Strato</span>,&mdash;who,
upon the successful issue of the Rebellion, and breaking
of the foreign yoke imposed by Persia, was instantly
elected Sovereign,&mdash;the Royal title continued
to his descendants, even to the last King of the Tyrians.</p>

<p>475 <small>B. C.</small>] From this time forward, Tyrus continued
not only to enlarge her Navigation, but to increase her
<em>inland</em> commerce. One of the chief complaints made by
the Prophet <span class="smcap">Nehemiah</span> against his countrymen was,&mdash;that
their Sabbath was desecrated by buying merchandise
of the Tyrians upon the Holy-Day. <span class="smcap">Nehemiah</span>
caused the traffickers to be thrust out of Jerusalem more
than once, and the Gates to be closed upon them;
but they still lingered around the walls in order to
sell their commodities on the Jewish Sabbath,&mdash;upon
which the Chief Ruler of the restored House of Judah,
instantly threatened to have recourse to violence, and
drive the Tyrian merchants from their locality. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
event [434 <small>B. C.</small>] was forty-one years after the accession
of the new dynasty.</p>

<p>It was no sin in the estimation of the Tyrians to
<em>sell</em> upon the Sabbath Day of Israel, for they being
heathens they did not esteem that Seventh day:&mdash;the
crime was, that of <em>buying</em> by the Jews upon their
own Sacred Sabbath.&mdash;In this manner is it justly reproved
by <span class="smcap">Nehemiah</span>: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>"There dwelt men of Tyrus also therein [<em>i. e.</em> in Jerusalem],
which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and
sold on the Sabbath unto the Children of Judah, and
in Jerusalem. Then I contended with the nobles of
Judah and said unto them, What evil thing is this that
ye do, and profane the Sabbath Day? And it came
to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be
dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates
should be shut, and charged that they should not be
opened till after the Sabbath: and some of my servants
[guards] set I at the gates, that there should be no
burden brought in on the Sabbath Day. So the merchants
and sellers of all kinds of ware <em>[i. e.</em> the Tyrians]
lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. Then
I testified against them, and said unto them, 'Why
lodge ye about the wall? If ye do so again, I will
lay hands upon you!' From that time forth came they
no more on the Sabbath." [Jeremiah xiii. 16&mdash;21.]</p>

<p>Jerusalem is about 80 miles from Tyrus, and the
Merchants of the latter Capital must have had communication
with the former by land conveyance only,&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
they may have landed at Joppa [Jaffa], as in the
days of Hiram, and from thence by Camel conveyance
to Jerusalem. In either case the words of <span class="smcap">Nehemiah</span>
prove that Tyrians themselves were at the Holy-City
as merchants and traders; and that consequently their
commercial intercourse, at this time, was by land, as
well as by water, with distant countries.</p>

<p>The same spirit of Monopoly which had actuated
the early Tyrians, was still professed and practised by
their descendants;&mdash;but, with Sidon, their Parent,&mdash;and
Carthage, their Daughter, were they on terms of
friendship and reciprocity. This continued throughout
the following century, when the sympathy and
gratitude of both Nations were evinced upon the last
solemn occasion of Tyrian Nationality in Asia. With
every other country, and especially with Rome, they
betrayed their envy and growing jealousy. The
incident related [Vol. i., Book ii., ch. iii.] in reference
to the ingenious stratagem of the Tyrians in entrapping
the Roman Galley, whereby it and the crew were
totally lost, while they themselves were saved, and the
secret of their discovery secured,&mdash;is but one of many
proofs of the National character. This same feeling
would naturally lead them to conceal from all foreign
countries their previous discovery of the Fortunate
Isles,&mdash;they were their own,&mdash;and none but the Tyrians
knew of their locality;&mdash;which knowledge gave them
the means of finding a temporary resting-place, from
the devastating effects of an approaching whirlwind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>335 <small>B. C.</small>] Allowing twenty years as the average
reign of the Sovereigns, <span class="smcap">Azelmic</span> would be the eighth
king in the present family, including <span class="smcap">Strato</span>, the original
founder of the last line of Tyrian Monarchs.</p>

<p>We have now approached to the great National
event, which led a portion of the Asiatic family to become
the Aborigines of the Southern (or Mexican)
division of the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>As we believe that the reader will have admitted
that the Tyrians are identified as the original Builders
of the ruined edifices in America,&mdash;and that this was
sufficiently established in the first Book of this Volume,&mdash;the
chief circumstances then to be established, are the
<em>time</em> and <em>means</em> in which, and whereby, they reached
the Western Continent. And, also, is it essentially required
to prove a sufficient <em>cause</em> leading to these
eventful incidents in a Nation's History. In the following
chapters we believe that the Veil of Mystery&mdash;woven
even by the hands of the Prophets&mdash;will be
raised from that creating <em>cause</em>,&mdash;and by so doing, it
will not only unfold Time's Romance in Ancient
America, but uphold the truth of Prophecy, and
therefore of the <em>past</em>: explain the latest wonder of the
<em>present</em> age; and we would feign indulge the hope,
that, with the preceding pages, and those to follow,&mdash;not
without some beneficial reflections for that of the
<em>future</em>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>(335-332 <small>B. C.</small>)</h3>

<p class="center">AZELMIC,</p>

<p class="center">THE LAST OF THE TYRIAN MONARCHS.</p>

<p class="center">REVIEW OF THE KINGDOM OF TYRUS,<br />

AT<br />

THE INVASION OF ASIA BY ALEXANDER OF MACEDON.</p>

<p class="center">THE INVESTMENT OF TYRUS, &amp;c.
</p>


<p>We have now to investigate and delineate the most
remarkable Siege in ancient record,&mdash;not remarkable
from its duration of time, but from its important consequences,&mdash;the
ingenuity employed in its final success,&mdash;the
courage of the attack and defence,&mdash;and from the
demoniac horrors and cruelties practised by the Conqueror
upon its eventful termination. The destruction of
Jerusalem by Titus was 400 years after this total annihilation
of Tyrus as a Nation,&mdash;and, therefore, to the
period of which we are now writing, Alexander's Siege
of Tyrus stands unequalled for courageous assault, heroic
resistance, and for refined cruelty practised upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the defeated. Upon this great National event is
founded the essential basis of this History,&mdash;it is the
absolute commencement of the Annals of Ancient
America. <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, Plutarch, and Arrian are our authorities,&mdash;the
description of the Invasion and the Siege,&mdash;however
humble the delineation, is our own;&mdash;we mention
this, that in case it should fail to reach the full imagination
of the reader, that the demerits may fall upon the
right party,&mdash;or should it be the reverse, there may then
be an inclination to render the opposite tribute of justice&mdash;not
to the writer,&mdash;but to the reader,&mdash;that from the
horrors of War, he may turn with a Christian's feeling
to contemplate the Divine blessings of Peace,&mdash;and
as a consequence, practical good-will and deeds to all
men.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to present a review of the political
and commercial position of Tyrus at the time
that Alexander of Macedon (at the age of 20!) commenced
his victorious march from his throne in Europe,
through the great capitals of Asia and Africa. 336&mdash;5
<small>B. C.</small></p>

<p>335 <small>B. C.</small>] Azelmic, the descendant of Strato,
wielded the Sceptre with patriotic energy and justice,
and at this period Tyrus was at the very height of
splendour and renown. The "Queen of the Sea" had
extended her navigation beyond any other period of
her past history. Her throne being now upon the
Island only,&mdash;which was citadelled and bastioned, with
the Mediterranean itself for a water-moat, (and that nearly
half a mile in width,) and flowing between the mainland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
and the outward walls, and they proudly rising
to an elevation of one hundred and fifty feet,&mdash;this
combination for defence caused her to defy every assault
from man, or even the warfare of elements!</p>

<p>Upon the Island arose her gorgeous Palaces and Edifices,
and conspicuous above them all, soared the lofty
and brilliant Temple of Hercules-Apollo, the chosen
Deity of the Tyrians. In the centre of the Mansion
of their Religion, stood a Statue of pure and beaten
gold, sacred to the glowing Sun-God; in the front of
Apollo's image was the Altar of the Country, composed
of precious stones and metals,&mdash;of engraved and
sparkling gems,&mdash;sculptured gold and silver,&mdash;wrought
by the descendants of the Hiramic artists, whose renowned
works gave extended and lasting fame to the
truly Sacred Temple of Jerusalem. Upon the authority
of the foredooming Prophet,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>&mdash;who
spoke of Tyrus two centuries and a half prior to this
period, her Commerce (and which now was of the
Ph&oelig;nix character,&mdash;and from which fact writers have
traced her name of Ph&oelig;nice)&mdash;her Commerce and
Shipbuilding were as renowned as her adventurious
spirit was proverbial.</p>

<p>Even in that time her builders had perfected her
beauty. The Tyrian Galleys were of peculiar strength
and elegance, and their "means and appliances" are especially
dwelt upon by the Prophet. Senir furnished the
fir-wood for planks and decks,&mdash;Lebanon the cedar for
masts, yards, and timber,&mdash;Bashan the oak for the
powerful oars,&mdash;the Rowers' benches were of Ivory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
from Ethiopia and India,&mdash;the sails were of embroidered
fine linen from Egypt,&mdash;and the awning canopies
of blue and purple cloths, tinted with the renowned
colour of her robes of royalty. Mariners
were constantly received from Sidon and Arvad,&mdash;the
important business of the caulkers was confined to the
"wise men" of Gebal,&mdash;but the builders and pilots
were Tyrians only. To all the Nations enumerated by
<span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> from whence riches were received in exchange
for merchandise, are now [335 <small>B. C.</small>] to be added the
Islands in, and the capitals bordering upon, the Mediterranean,&mdash;viz.,
Rhodes, Sardinia, Sicily, Melita, Corsica,
and the Baleares; Ægina, Crete, Candia, Cyprus,
Corcyra, and all the Grecian and Ionian Isles;
the newly-discovered lands of Britain and Hibernia,
the former being named by the Tyrians;&mdash;every Port
from the mouth of the Menander to the "Pillars" at
Gibraltar; from the borders of Dalmatia to the opposite
shores of the Adriatic;&mdash;from the shores of Gaul
and Iberia to the harbours of Etruria,&mdash;and to all
these commercial tributaries of Tyrus, are to be added
those giants of antiquity, Athens, Rome, and Carthage!
Truly, then, in the language of the inspired writer,
<span class="smcap">Zechariah</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tyrus did build herself a strong hold; and heaped
up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the
street."</p>

<p>The same false Commercial policy was pursued by
the Tyrians, as in their more ancient days, when Pride
and Envy were their injurious counsellors. Their hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
were raised against every nation seeking to enrich
itself through the means of Navigation;&mdash;those countries
were viewed by the Tyrians as the mere instruments
of their own advancement. Sidon and Carthage
were alone excepted from the National jealousy;
and even this exception to the rule was founded upon
selfishness, arising from the memory of blood and kindred,
and not from any sentiment of liberal policy.
The Metropolis being now on the Island, they felt
safe from the approach of an enemy by land,&mdash;while
their surrounding walls rendered them "quiet and
secure" from every assault by Naval warfare as then
practised. In this imperial state of confident security,
founded upon Pride, locality, but above all by commercial
Monopoly, stood the Island-Kingdom of Tyrus,
as her death-knell was sounded from afar by the rising
Monarch of Macedonia.</p>

<p>Throughout the surrounding Nations the Islanders
had "sown the wind,"&mdash;they were now, as a consequence,
"to reap the whirlwind," and no one to check,
or blight, the pride-harvest of the hurricane!</p>

<p>Alexander commenced his triumphant march in the
year 336 <small>B. C.</small>, and not having a sufficient cause for his
foreign invasions (Persia and Media excepted), may be
justly looked upon, at this day, as the human Juggernaut
of Antiquity! The Prophet <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>, two centuries
before the period of which this event treats, stigmatized
this vaunted hero, when comparing him with the
Kings of Media and Persia,&mdash;the latter to the horns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the Ram, while the former is likened unto the brute
Goat of the mountains.</p>

<p>"And the rough goat is the King of Grecia." [Daniel
viii. 21.]</p>

<p>It is not necessary to trace the progress of Alexander
in Asia, only so far as it may have had an influence
upon the fate and fall of Tyrus.</p>

<p>After the Passage of the Granicus, and in the next
year, the great victory at Issus, whereby the Persian
kingdom was shaken, the lesser nations begun to contemplate
the increasing power of Alexander with
alarm, and to reflect upon the best means of averting
impending ruin. The only alternative from battle was
to become tributary, or to obtain the special favour of
the Invader.</p>

<p>Sidon made application, through ambassadors, to
Alexander for his protection, and was thus saved from destruction
by anticipating the conflict through a tributary
surrender:&mdash;and which voluntary act satisfied the Macedonian,
who stipulated, however, that he should
place a new King upon the throne. This was agreed
to, and Byblos and Aradnus joined in the humiliating
surrender.</p>

<p>In compliment to his favourite,&mdash;Hephæstion,&mdash;the
Conqueror allowed him to appoint whom he pleased
for King of Sidon. Hephæstion, thereupon, selected a
poor man of the Capital by the name of Strato, and
instantly raised him to the dignity of Sidonian Sovereign.
The mendicant was a remote branch of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Royal House, but had been unjustly degraded by the
reigning Monarch. When the new-raised King had
his first interview with Alexander, his grateful remark
was&mdash;"I pray that Apollo will enable you, Alexander,
to bear prosperity with the same fortitude, with which
I have struggled with adversity!"</p>

<p>The Macedonian highly applauded the philosophical
point of the remark, and secured him in his new possession.</p>

<p>As no great gift can be without a referential motive,
either to the past, or for the future,&mdash;the donation by
Hephæstion, where no past service had deserved it
(and there were nearer branches of the Royal House
than Strato), must have had, therefore, some deep
meaning. It is only long after historic events are passed
and analyzed, that they can be calmly or correctly
judged; and in tracing Alexander's approach to the
celebrated "Daughter of Sidon," this donation of a
throne,&mdash;and to the party receiving it,&mdash;was in direct
flattery to Tyrus; as in like manner, at a subsequent
period, Marcus Antonius presented provinces to Egypt
to secure the sun-clad and voluptuous Cleopatra!</p>

<p>The subjugation of Tyrus by <em>policy</em> was one of the
schemes of Alexander,&mdash;for avoiding its destruction,&mdash;he
would then be sure of Navies, Pilots, and Mariners,
to carry his warfare, at a later period, to the river
Tiber and to Rome itself;&mdash;for his thirst of Conquest,&mdash;had
it not been allayed by the poison-draught in
Asia,&mdash;could only have been quenched within the
great Capital of Italy. Alexander, therefore, flattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the Tyrians by raising to the throne of Sidon, a man
who bore the same name,&mdash;(Strato) and was of the
same family as the Founder of the present dynasty at
Tyrus; and consequently, remotely related to Azelmic,
whom Alexander endeavoured (by this act of
apparent generosity) to circumvent and overthrow by
<em>policy</em>, not warfare. Historians have applauded the
justice of Hephæstion,&mdash;they should have analyzed
the deep-laid scheming of his Master,&mdash;who merely
employed his favourite, to mask his own deep intent
upon the great Commercial emporium of the World.
The Tyrians, however, were practical <em>merchant-princes</em>,
and were not to be deceived by any species of <em>exchange</em>,
although Kings were the commodity.</p>

<p>334 <small>B. C.</small>] The unforeseen capitulation of Sidon,&mdash;the
Mother-land,&mdash;aroused the Tyrians to a sense of
their own position,&mdash;Sidon, Byblos, and Aradnus, had
surrendered,&mdash;these Capitals, therefore, could not aid
the Merchant-Metropolis. To increase the apprehension
of the Tyrians, it was reported through the continued
policy of Alexander, that he was, also, attended
by a fleet of Galleys to cover any retreat,&mdash;or to land,
and reconvey his troops from, or to any point, from the
Bosphorous to the Nile,&mdash;or from thence to Carthage.
The Conqueror had, however, in reality, dismissed his
fleet before the victory of Issus, in order to inspire his
troops with additional courage, from the then apparent
fact, that they had no means of retreat from the
enemies' country by the means of Galleys. He must
have remembered that that feeling of safety of retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
lost the Persians the Battle of Marathon. [490 <small>B. C.</small>]
The Macedonian had another motive in reporting that
his fleet was approaching,&mdash;viz., To take the Tyrian
attention from any land defence, by enforcing the
belief that the attack would be by means of the Navy.
He knew, also, that Azelmic and his People had no
extensive knowledge of <em>Military</em> Science,&mdash;for they
could have no occasion for its exercise, occasioned by
their Island locality,&mdash;their high-reared walls being
their bulwarks:&mdash;and they consequently commenced,
as he expected, preparations for a Naval Conflict:&mdash;but,
unknown to Alexander they had formed a masterly
design, viz., to attack him both by land and sea,
and that simultaneously; thence, if the Macedonian
lost a land battle, and his fleet dispersed, (no difficult
matter for the Tyrians) it would be easy to arouse
other nations to crush the Invader. Tyrus, however,
had no army fit to cope with Alexander, in any general
engagement, and especially with his Phalanx and
Cavalry. Azelmic, therefore, secretly despatched special
Envoys to his only remaining ally,&mdash;viz., Carthage,&mdash;for
no other nation could be with safety applied to
in any emergency,&mdash;except Sidon,&mdash;for the treatment
by the Tyrians to other countries had alienated every
sentiment of National friendship. In their pride and
prosperity they had forgotten that adversity may
come! Sidon had capitulated, and received nearly an
alien King,&mdash;Carthage, therefore, alone remained. Azelmic's
ambassadors were received by the Tyro-Carthaginians
with every demonstration of respect, as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
due to a Nation from which they themselves had
sprung. The answer to the application for an Army
to oppose the advance of Alexander upon Tyrus, could
only be divulged by, and within the Senate of the
Republic; the Envoys were, therefore, courteously
dismissed with presents and honours, together with
the assurance that a speedy reply should be sent to
the Island-Capital.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the policy of Azelmic was still
further employed to circumvent that of Alexander's,&mdash;for
during the absence of the Envoys he endeavoured
to flatter the wily Macedonian in his own manner;
and thereupon sent as a present to him a splendid
golden Crown, as a friendly compliment:&mdash;this was received
with apparent feelings of amity, and in return,
Philip's Son desired to <em>honour</em> Tyrus by worshipping
in person, (with his Officers,) in the Temple of Hercules-Apollo!
Azelmic sarcastically replied to this effect, on behalf
of Tyrus,&mdash;viz., that the <em>honour</em> intended by Alexander
in <em>entering the Metropolis</em>, and worshipping, with
his followers, (for his <em>suite</em> would have been the entire
Army) in the Chief Temple of the Nation was duly
appreciated, and more than they <em>deserved</em>, or were
desirous of <em>receiving</em>,&mdash;that since the Hero of Macedon
only desired to pay his tribute of respect to the Temple
of Hercules-Apollo, that could be done amid the Ruins
of the <em>Old Temple on the Mainland</em>; and that from the
summit of the walls of the Island-City,&mdash;Azelmic, his
Nobles, and People, would witness the ceremony!
Alexander, of course, declined the offer,&mdash;at once perceiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
that his scheme of entering Tyrus was frustrated:
and he, also, almost simultaneously with this invitation
to worship in the Ruined Temple, received intelligence
of the important embassy secretly sent to Carthage.
Alexander, therefore, instantly found that he
had cause to view in Azelmic and his People, foes
whose forethought and consequent judgment, might
replace any deficiency that might be apparent from the
want of an organised Army. The two rival Monarchs
awaited with anxiety the reply of Carthage. In the
mean time the Republican Senate [333 <small>B. C.</small>] held
the final conference upon the subject of the Tyrian
solicitation,&mdash;and thereupon, deputed thirty of the
chief Citizens of Carthage as a delegation, to convey to
Azelmic the following unlooked for reply: viz.&mdash;That
the Senate viewed with deep condolence the present,
and approaching condition of the home of their ancestors:&mdash;but,
upon contemplation of the position of Carthage
itself, they deeply regretted to find, that it precluded
even the remote possibility of sending troops or
succour to Tyrus!</p>

<p>Thus Carthage, apparently safe from the present
approaches of Alexander, had her own fears of Invasion;
yet had the Senate acceded to the wish of Tyrus,
the two nations, by forming a junction, might have
successfully opposed the further advance of the enemy;
but Carthage had resolved (like Sidon) to save herself
by policy, not warfare.</p>

<p>The Senate of Carthage, therefore, (following the
Sidonian example) deputed an Ambassador to Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
in order to secure his favour, or by a tribute to
remain in peace. They consequently deputed for the
important and National embassy,&mdash;Rhodanus,&mdash;a man
possessing extraordinary address and beauty of person,
supported by the fascination of the most accomplished
eloquence. The insinuating manners, and flattery of
Rhodanus, (who was presented by Parmenio,) together
with his gallant bearing, had such a magical effect upon
the vain Macedonian, that he instantly cast a friendly
eye upon Carthage:&mdash;thus, that Country was saved
from invasion by the cheapest, yet most valued tribute
in the mind of the hero of the Granicus,&mdash;viz., Flattery.
Jaddus, the High-Priest of Judæa, subsequently saved
Jerusalem in the same manner, by producing the Prophecy
of <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>, and identifying Alexander as "<em>the</em>
King of Grecia,"&mdash;the "rough goat" of the prediction.</p>

<p>Rhodanus accompanied the Son of Philip in all his
after-expeditions, and consequently had power, and did
transmit to Carthage the plans of his new Master, who
had no suspicion of his flatterer's treachery. Rhodanus
saved his country,&mdash;and yet upon his return to Carthage,
he was looked upon as a traitor, from having
served in the army of the Grecian, and was thereupon
sentenced to death:&mdash;ingratitude and barbarity carried
the decree into execution.</p>

<p>The reply of the Republic to Azelmic's application
for troops, cast a foreboding gloom over the spirits of
his subjects. It was too late now to supplicate to Alexander
and receive from him the same terms, as had
been granted to either Sidon or Carthage; for it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
known to the Invader, that a solicitation for an Army
had been made to Carthage and refused; which point
was naturally not lost by Rhodanus in his eloquent appeal;
for he represented the denial as having emanated
not so much from fear, or hope of favour, as from admiration
and love of Alexander and his Glory!</p>

<p>The Tyrians were, therefore, now left solitary and
alone, as a majestic Column in the desert of Nations:
they had now to depend upon their own solid base for
support. Their chief weapon was their ancient Pride,
which was daily being transfused from the brittle character
of its metal, into the more pliable and useful
temper of true courage; enabling its possessor to correctly
analyze and appreciate the powers of an opponent.
This courage, and their walled and Island-Citadel, enabled
them to laugh to scorn the approach of the
Macedonian: for intelligence had been received by
them, that his Navy had been dismissed, and that the
original report of its bearing down upon Tyrus, was
but "a stratagem of the Invader."</p>

<p>Alexander's army now advanced, and commenced
hostilities by destroying the suburbs of Tyrus situate
upon the mainland; the inhabitants of which had previously
entered the Island-Metropolis. Thus was the
Last Siege of Tyrus commenced in the eleventh Hebrew
month,&mdash;Shebat,&mdash;(January-February) in the year 332
before the Christian Æra.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>(JANUARY&mdash;AUGUST, 332 <small>B. C.</small>)</h3>

<p class="center">
THE SIEGE AND DESTRUCTION OF TYRUS,<br />

BY ALEXANDER OF MACEDON;<br />

AND<br />

THE HEROIC DEFENCE BY AZELMIC AND THE NATION.<br />
</p>


<p>This great National event in the History of an
Ancient People, was commenced by Alexander in
person, attended and assisted by the renowned Generals
and favourites&mdash;Hephæstion, Antigonus, Seleucus, Lysimachus,
Cassander, Ptolemeus, "Old Clytus," and
Parmenio,&mdash;all of whom, except the first and two last
named, subsequently became the successors to, and
sharers of, their Master's army and ill-gotten dominions.</p>

<p>Upon the occupation of the mainland suburbs (the
Tyrians and strangers having fled to the Island), all the
then known engines of warfare (both of defence and
offence) were constructed and arranged upon the shore,&mdash;the
army encamped on elevated ground, so as to be
seen from the Capital,&mdash;the Cavalry and Phalanx daily
practised their complex evolutions,&mdash;all this display<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
was for the purpose of intimidating the besieged,&mdash;but
it failed in its intended object. Orders were then given
to commence an attack, not so much upon the walls, as
upon the People, by throwing into the City darts and
missiles: but, high Towers for the bowmen,&mdash;Balistæ
for discharging heavy stones,&mdash;Catapultæ for casting
forth the deadly javelin,&mdash;were erected with no effect;
for the clouds of lightning-arrows, and the heavy thunderbolts
of war burst forth in vain; and the distant
walls remained unscathed, and the Tyrians unharmed.
Alexander must now have found the error in dismissing
his Navy after the Passage of the Granicus: had he
retained it, he would have been enabled, upon a victory
over the Tyrian fleet, to have surrounded the walls,
and so prevent supplies from entering the Metropolis;
but which were now daily received by the besieged,
without the power of prevention on the part of the
Macedonian. In this dilemma Alexander proposed to
Azelmic and his Council, terms of capitulation similar
to those accepted by the Sidonians; but with the original
proposition of offering a sacrifice in the temple of
Hercules-Apollo. The "sacrifice" would have been
the entire People! The Tyrians, however, feeling safe
within their walls, received the proffered negotiation
with scorn and contempt; and in regard to the last proposition,
they still resolved not to admit Alexander, or
even his peace-offering.</p>

<p>The Macedonian now felt for the first time, that his
hitherto untarnished glory might be dimmed,&mdash;his future
pathway might be clouded,&mdash;for to abandon the Siege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
would instantly destroy his reputation for invincibility.
Even his Generals were at a loss for means to conceal
their mortification, or of resources of invention, whereby
the reduction of the Capital could be accomplished.
They, however, suggested to Alexander, that his
already brilliant fame would not be clouded, by passing
on to other victories obtainable upon the land; for it
was not originally intended in his present advance, to
attack a strongly-fortified Island, surrounded by the
broad waters of the Mediterranean, and with high walls
based upon the very waves of that Sea; and then the
distance of the Isle from the mainland, placed the besieged
out of the reach of either fear or danger; and
especially in the absence of his fleet. These and similar
arguments were of no avail; for every suggestion of a
present, or of a future difficulty, only increased Alexander's
resolution to conquer.</p>

<p>The Prince in his early youth had Nature for his
guide,&mdash;and that great Monitress then led him to accomplish
his first victory: for the untameable horse,
Bucephalus,&mdash;the Mazeppa-charger of Macedonia,&mdash;was
not subdued from merely having the Lord of Wit
or Wisdom by his side, but because he exercised the
high gift for which he had been so justly named.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He,
therefore, <em>did</em> turn the head of the proud animal "towards
the East;" and in paying this supposed tribute
to Apollo, he compelled the fiery steed <em>to gaze upon
the dazzling Sun</em>!&mdash;and while thus partially blinded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
by the brilliant rays, the dauntless rider mounted him,
and the noble animal, feeling for the first time the
weight of man,&mdash;the lash and the deep-wounding spur,&mdash;forth
he bounded like an earthly Pegasus,&mdash;clouds of
sand and dust rising from beneath his earth-spurning,
and indignant hoofs, concealed from the royal Father's
sight the form of his princely Son, and the now maddened
steed:&mdash;yet on he flew, like a Sirocco blast before
the hurricane&mdash;his eyes still towards, and in, the dazzling
Sunlight:&mdash;but, ere Apollo had reached the
zenith, the horse and rider returned to the royal presence,
the latter triumphant, and the former for the
first time subdued, and gazing upon his shadow! Thus
by Nature, and her laws, did he tame the fiery spirit!</p>

<p>It was a similar thought that led him to conceive
the means for subduing the apparently unconquerable
spirit of the proud Tyrian, safe within his untouched
Island-Citadel,&mdash;as that which led him upon the plain
of Macedon, to master the white steed Bucephalus&mdash;who
now stood prancing upon the moonlit shore of ancient
Tyrus, with his Princely Master upon his gracefully-curved
back as upon a throne of ivory:&mdash;from this
regal seat,&mdash;while the noble steed gazed upon the
phosphoric sparkles of the radiant sea, as the waves
cast them at his feet,&mdash;the pupil of Aristotle contemplated
the apparently hopeless Siege of the commercial
emporium of the World! That contemplation placed
before him the fact, that Nature was to be subdued before
the successful appliances of Art could be brought
to bear upon and support his resolution. It forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
upon him the conclusion that he had not only to war
against Island walls, and Patriot hearts within,&mdash;but
against another kingdom over which the trident monarch&mdash;Neptune&mdash;reigned,
guarding with safety and
with honour the renowned "Queen of the Sea,"&mdash;that
he must drive back that victorious ally before he could
even hope to capture her coronet of freedom! He
remembered, too, that both the Babylonian and the
Persian had retired, leaving their victories imperfect
by not subduing the Island;&mdash;this was an additional
reason why he resolved to conquer, that his military
glory should, in the estimation of posterity, be beyond
any predecessor.</p>

<p>While many of the principal Officers held a midnight
council of war,&mdash;the towers and engines standing tenant-less
and unmanned, from their inutility,&mdash;Alexander,
upon his snowy steed, pacing the wave-washed shore,
and ruminating upon his new conception,&mdash;Hephæstion
and Parmenio upon their war-chargers, and as the
attendants for the night, gazing upon the movements
of their chief with that military anxiety which the
warrior only knows or can feel,&mdash;and the soldiers of
Macedonia murmuring within the camp at inactivity;&mdash;while
this picture was presented of the invaders, the
inhabitants of the metropolis had almost ceased to
think that war and danger were near, and from their
walls, as the Moon arose, they expressed every joy to
their Goddess,&mdash;Astart&#275;,&mdash;for the safety that she now
witnessed and smiled upon. Alexander arousing himself
from his visioned victory,&mdash;but more from the derisionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
laughter of the foe, who had now discerned
him, instantly dashed with his proud Bucephalus into
the moonlit waters of the Mediterranean, and so toward
the walls,&mdash;as if to commence in person the first
assault upon the domain of Neptune! Hephæstion
and Parmenio&mdash;as at the passage of the Granicus&mdash;instantly
followed their Prince to cover his safe return
to the shore; for a clouded shadow passed swift as a
meteor over the waters towards the noble group,&mdash;a
whizzing like a sudden blast was heard,&mdash;then a cutting
in the waves like the swift fins of the shark,&mdash;and
a rattling as of hail upon armour;&mdash;it was a flight of
arrows from the walls, but they failed to reach the unpanoplied
body of the chief, guarded as he was by the
devotional shields and helms of his companions,&mdash;who
had seen the action of the besieged, and had watched
the speeding of the surcharged deadly cloud! Refreshed
from the plunge, and aroused to a sense of his
own danger, by that of his friends, Alexander returned
to the shore, and with speed to the royal pavilion,&mdash;where,
springing from his seat, he may be
imagined to have thus addressed his noble steed:</p>

<p>"Brave companion of my youth! you have commenced
the attack upon the Tyrian moat,&mdash;we will
pass it,&mdash;Victory shall be ours!"</p>

<p>That night the fate of Tyrus was written!&mdash;for
Alexander had conceived the idea, and commanded
that a Causeway, or military mole, should <em>be constructed
from the Shore to the Island</em>! The ruins of which extraordinary
work are seen even at this day!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tyrian sentinel at early dawn gave intelligence
of a new movement in the army of the invaders,&mdash;the
rampart walls were instantly crowded with citizens, to
watch the motion upon the point, forming the nearest
distance between themselves and the shore. They beheld
the removing of the several war-engines and
towers,&mdash;and thereupon gave a wild shout of joy at
the supposed <em>retreat</em> of the Macedonians! Fatal
error! That loud shout which had aroused even the
mangered horses of the foe, at once proclaimed their
present triumph, and their future doom!</p>

<p>The new orders of Alexander were received in the
camp with pride and gladness; and with alacrity were
collected every kind of material;&mdash;timbers from the
captured houses on shore, and new-felled trees for piles
and outward dams,&mdash;old vessels, and decayed merchant-galleys,
left upon the beach by the Tyrians as
useless, were filled with stone, and sunk for the foundation,
upon which the superstructure was to be
erected,&mdash;the sunken galleys, also, arrested the progress
of the sea-sand in its passage between the Island and
the beach, and thus aided the formation of the base.
The different portions of the army were then engaged
in bringing thousands, and tens of thousands, of sacks
and loads of earth and stone,&mdash;every activity and
energy were manifested by men and officers, encouraged
as they were by the personal presence of the
Princely Engineer.</p>

<p>At first the bold attempt only excited the increased
derision and laughter of the haughty Tyrians; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
that mockery of the lip, was gradually changed to a
clouded brow, as the Mole advanced, though with slow
degrees, towards the Island. At every foot of progressive
movement the difficulty of the Macedonian was
increased; for, as the passage narrowed, the waters
doubled their rapid rate, and nearly destroyed the
advancing work. The People of the Metropolis, with
the King and Nobles, viewed from the walls the first
month's labour with doubts and fears,&mdash;a second and
a third month passed, when the causeway reached
arrow-distance from the Island. At this point of advance,
Alexander, still anxious to obtain his rich prize
unharmed, and believing that the Tyrians were now
convinced of his resolution to conquer, despatched in
a royal barge several Envoys to propose terms of capitulation.
As the boat advanced to the edge of the
walls, and was approaching a port-gate, and when
directly beneath the overhanging parapet of a watch-tower,&mdash;a
ponderous mass of stone was suddenly
hurled from the rampart, upon the unsuspecting victims
beneath,&mdash;a crush was heard,&mdash;the shriek of Life at
the approach of sudden Death,&mdash;the splash and gurgling
of the waters,&mdash;and all had ceased. Envoys and
attendants had sunk, never to rise until that Day,
when even "the Sea shall give up its dead!"</p>

<p>The maddening fury of the Macedonian, now knew
no bounds, upon this (to him) murder of his Ambassadors,&mdash;though
to the Tyrians, they were only regarded
as Invaders. Energy was renewed upon the
Mole-work, and as it continued to advance, the besieged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
were aroused from their pride and confidence, to
depend upon courageous action alone,&mdash;they, thereupon,
became the assailants, and cast upon the approaching
foemen, showers of arrows, darts, stones, and
every species of missile weapon. The Macedonians
were guarded in part by their advancing towers, which
served as shields and screens to the military workmen,&mdash;yet
hundreds were daily slain,&mdash;nor were the Tyrians
without their death-list, for the wooden towers
were manned in every story, yet being but a third of
the height of the walls of the Capital, the advantage
therefore was more than tenfold to the Islanders.</p>

<p>The intelligence of the present movement of the
Macedonian, flew on the wings of gladness to the surrounding
Nations; where&mdash;through their own fears at
the success of such military talent&mdash;could be seen the
secret joy at the approaching downfall of a People,
whose very existence as a Nation, had been derived
from stern and uncompromising Monopoly;&mdash;who had
looked upon all other countries as the mere instruments
of her own imperious will. The inland Nations, and
those upon the borders of the Mediterranean, would
rather have suffered ruin than aid the Tyrian,&mdash;although
by an united effort they might have saved both
themselves and the Capital of Ph&oelig;nicia. Even Carthage,
like a degenerate Child, had from selfish policy
(the National heirloom) refused to lend her aid,
though to her Parent-Country. One Nation only (and
that was tributary to the Conqueror) received intelligence
of the gathering movements of the Macedonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
with sincere grief and active sympathy. It was the
sympathy of an imprisoned Mother, when, from her
iron bars, she beholds her only Daughter about to be
chained to the fire-stand of remorseless doom! Thus
the Sidonian Parent gazed upon her Tyrian Daughter,
resolved, should occasion offer, to render that aid which
a Mother ever feels is due to her filial offspring,&mdash;and in
this instance, though at the hazard of her own destruction.</p>

<p>While the Military movements were progressing
with apparent success, the efforts of the attendant Naval
operations of Alexander (who had changed some of
his mainland captures into vessels of war) were equally
triumphant,&mdash;for many Tyrian Galleys were seized,
they being chiefly Merchantmen, and deserted by the
Pilots, Mariners, and Rowers, in order to aid the
defending of the City. In the words of <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>, regarding
Tyrus, and truly fulfilled:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And <em>all</em> that handle the <em>Oar</em>,&mdash;the <em>Mariners</em>, and
<em>all the Pilots</em> of the Sea, <em>shall come down from their
ships,&mdash;they shall stand upon the land</em>!" [<em>i. e.</em> in the
City.]</p>

<p>Many of the ships were destroyed by the Tyrians
themselves, upon the Pilots and Mariners leaving them
to defend the Capital,&mdash;to prevent their falling into the
hands of the Macedonian;&mdash;who, however, succeeded
in capturing vessels returning from foreign voyages,&mdash;and
instantly manning those as being of better construction,
they consequently sunk the old vessels on either
side of the approaching Mole, thus forming the outward
parallels of this giant causeway of the Mediterranean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
Thus were the Tyrian vessels entirely captured,&mdash;or
destroyed by the contending foes,&mdash;and consequently
the lion-hearted citizens were now hemmed in a walled
cavern,&mdash;with the "rough" and furious hunter, attended
by his yelling blood-hounds, guarding every
outlet towards the land, to prevent escape, or even the
attempt in the wild moments of despair!</p>

<p>About this period of the Siege, Darius of Persia,
hearing of the present Military undertaking of Alexander,
and of its probable success, sent to the Conqueror
several Envoys, as a deputation to propose
terms of peace and amity for his own nation:&mdash;contemplating
his approaching triumph, all propositions
were rejected by the Victor of Issus! His pride was
also wounded by the Despatches being addressed simply
to "Alexander of Macedon,"&mdash;without the title of
"King" being in any part employed in the proposal.
The young Monarch, however, had his revenge upon
this point of neglected diplomacy, for in his answer,
he addressed his foreign adversary, whom he had
beaten in two battles, to the following effect:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Alexander</span>
of <em>Macedon</em> refuses to accede to the
terms of surrender and amity, proposed to him by
Darius, the powerful <em>King</em> of Persia and Media."</p>

<p>July, 332 <small>B. C.</small>] In the sixth month from the commencement
of the siege, the invaders had advanced to
the foot of the walls, and in approaching they widened
the Causeway, in order to enable them to have greater
space for carrying on the operations of Storming the
Capital. Upon the successful termination of constructing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the Mole, the engines of ancient warfare were
placed in their several localities for active service. In
front, and near to the walls (which were of soft stone
and stuccoed), were stationed several battering-rams of
enormous magnitude and power, and swung from high
triangles and towers, in order to batter the upper, and
consequently the weakest part of the mural defence.
Behind these engines, at a short distance, were placed
the powerful Balistæ and Catapultæ for throwing stones
and timber, darts and javelins into the city. In the
third position from the walls, were stationed several
high wooden-towers, from four to six stories in altitude,
and manned with archers; each story had its
drawbridge, both for defence, and to let down upon, or
into any breach that might be made, and from which
bridge the archers and spearmen could pass on to the
walls, upon the huge machines being wheeled forward
by the Soldiery in the rear of the towers. The now
Grecian Galleys (captured from the Tyrians) were
brought and moored along the sides of the Mole,
having their lines trebled near, and especially at the
Island-base of the causeway. This precaution was to
prevent escape in case of any sortie; as, also, to give
protection to the new Military work against the continual
injury from the waves. This action and locality
of the captured vessels <em>left the walls towards the Sea
unwatched</em>, and it was considered by the invaders as
useless to keep their small fleet dispersed, when no
escape could be made by the Tyrians in that quarter,
from the want of vessels; therefore, from the oblong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
form of the Island-Capital (its sides being parallel with
the Sea and the mainland), <em>it would prevent those engaged
at the Causeway, from seeing any movement or
enterprise, that might be undertaken at the Seaward
gates of the Metropolis</em>. This fact is of great importance,
and for the full appreciation of the result, the reader
should not let it escape from memory. During the successful
advance, the Tyrians had been incessant in
their defence of Nature's Moat; but, now that it was
passed by the enemy, their only duty was to prevent a
breach being made in the wall: this defence was comparatively
easy, for the attack could only be made upon
one point, and the only approach to that assault was
over the Causeway.</p>

<p>When Alexander had personally inspected the fulfilment
of his instructions, he commanded a simultaneous
assault to be made upon the wall and city, from every
warlike engine on the Causeway. It was useless: the
brave defence exceeded in its results any injury received
from the spirit of the attack; for where the battering-rams
would otherwise have had effect, bales of
cloths, linen and wool were hung, so that no impression
could be made; at the same time hundreds of the invaders
were crushed or slain by the high-mounted
besieged, who continued to hurl down upon those beneath,
and upon their works, ponderous stones, showers
of darts and javelins, together with ignited combustibles
and fascines. In this manner were several attempts
upon the City completely foiled by the Tyrians.
The Macedonians were, therefore, compelled to retire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
towards the shore, for the purpose of repairing their
shattered and burnt engines and towers;&mdash;and who,
amid the irreverend shouts of triumph from the Islanders,
daily buried their dead within the adjacent camp:
but these untimely rejoicings, and the death of the Envoys,
only the more securely sealed the judgment upon
Tyrus!</p>

<p>It has already been stated that the vessels composing
the captured fleet had been moored on either side of
the Causeway, and consequently they were placed between
the Island and the shore. Upon this disposition
of the Macedonian Navy being made known at <em>Sidon,
several of her most determined Citizens manned a
few of their own merchant-galleys, hoisted sails, and
lowered oars for Tyrus</em>, which was distant but twenty-three
miles. They arrived and hovered on the sea-side
of the Island, so as to be unperceived by the invaders;
and even if they were seen at, or after the storming of
the city, they were <em>Sidonians</em>, and would be treated by
the besiegers in a friendly manner, for they were already
tributary to the Macedonian. Their deep <em>intent</em>,
however, could not be known, and their <em>presence</em>
merely, would, therefore, pass unquestioned. Although,
by their intended act, a portion of the Sidonians broke
their treaty of surrender with Alexander, and were in
fact as guilty as if detected in the act itself, and consequently
within the sentence of death; still they were
determined to prove the truth of a prior faith to the
Tyrians, and were thus prepared to rescue any "remnant"
of their descendants, should the City be stormed
and taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no hollow friendship that amid the whirlwind
would come forth, and from the Conqueror's field of
blood&mdash;the Aceldama of his shame and cruelty&mdash;would
boldly "glean" the Tyrian "olive-tree," or the remaining
fruit from Slaughter's "vintage." This was an act
worthy of renown from the Sculptor's magic, yet enduring
Art, worthy to grace the "Chief Altar" of a
land, wherever the "gleanings" of the bloody-harvest
should be housed in safety!</p>

<p>August, 332 <small>B. C.</small>] In the seventh month of the
Siege, the invaders had repaired and increased the number
of their warlike engines and machines, and especially
those for battering down the walls. They were
now replaced, but stationed out of danger of the ignited
fascines, to await the final orders of the King of
Macedon, who had retired to the neighbouring Mountain
for recreation, until the preparations should be
completed for a renewal of the assault. In the mean
time the soldiers of Alexander, accustomed to speedy
victories, began to murmur at their long and arduous
duties, and at the number of their useless dead, which
had made their camp nearly a pestilential charnel-house.
They desired that the Siege should be instantly raised,
that they might march on to certain victories, and so
efface their present infamy of defeat. In these sentiments
they were joined by many of the subaltern officers;
and the growing spirit of open mutiny was roaming
through every division of the army.</p>

<p>During this cessation of active hostilities, the
Tyrians were making preparation for the great Annual
Festival in honour of their tutelary God,&mdash;Apollo,&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
had been postponed from the summer solstice,
owing to the position of the Siege. In this Religious
ceremony no one could be excused, or excluded; even
the sentinels from the ramparts must leave the steps of
war, for the paths of peace: all must join in devotion
and thanksgiving to the protecting Sun, which, as
Apollo, was supposed at Midsummer to reach his altitude
of beatific power. Any Tyrian, therefore, who
did not worship the rising of the great Deity of Ph&oelig;nicia
upon that day, was believed to be banished from
his genial influence, during the next annual circling of
their Zodiac.</p>

<p>It was in the fulness of the Moon's last quarter, in
the month of August, that Alexander, having left his
Pavilion on the Mountain, and wandering alone through
the deep vistas, suddenly cast his war-mantle at the
foot of a giant cedar of Lebanon; and reclining thereon,
perused a few pages of the Iliad, his fond and fatal
companion,&mdash;but from anxiety and fatigue was soon in
slumber. The sleeper was as solitary as the tree beneath
which he slept&mdash;for they were both alone in
station as they were in character. The Moon had risen
in unclouded splendour, and cast her beams, as in playfulness,
upon the child of fortune; like celestial Cynthia,
when, upon the retiring of her attendants&mdash;the Stars of
Night&mdash;she cast her virgin smiles upon the earthly
beauty, and youthful figure of Endymion; for the now
sleeping hero had seen but twenty-four summers, and
those without a cloud to dim their brilliancy. He now
dreamed of Tyrus and her downfall,&mdash;a smile played
around his lips, triumphant as Apollo's:&mdash;he suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
sprung to his feet and grasped his sword;&mdash;the action
was but the active portion of his visioned victory, for&mdash;</p>

<p>Alexander awoke, and beheld before him, waiting his
time of slumber, Hephæstion, and the War-Council.
They informed him that the preparations were ready for
another attack; they also announced the growing discontent
of the entire camp; that the spirits of the soldiery
were already depressed, from their tedious and
useless hardships; that the cavalry loudly murmured
from their total inutility through the present service:
they also forced upon him the reflection, that his reputation
might be injured, if the future assault upon the
walls should again prove ineffectual; and that every
gloom cast over the Macedonians, was a just cause to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
renew and continue the brilliant bravery of the Tyrians.
The King of Macedonia listened with unwonted placidity
to the remarks and covert advice from his
Council, and in reply told them,&mdash;<em>that Tyrus would be
captured within two days</em>,&mdash;that in a Vision of the
present night it was revealed to him that the Island
would be defenceless within that time!</p>

<p>The Council returned to the camp, where, the omen
contained in the reported Vision in Mount Lebanon
aroused their superstition and renewed their courage;
which Religious and warlike feelings were increased
seven-fold when, upon Alexander's return to the camp,
it was announced that some Tyrians (captured in the
galleys) had stated that the "morrow" was to be the
great National festival to Apollo!&mdash;and during which
ceremony&mdash;Alexander reasoned&mdash;the Island-Capital
would be in a manner defenceless!</p>

<p>It must have been at this discovery that the vain
Macedonian imagined he was descended from Apollo,
having for the time being cast aside his former claim to
be the son of Jupiter.</p>

<p>The Festival was applied by the army to the true
meaning of the dream, and that interpretation was received
by all as a certain harbinger of instant victory.
Orders were thereupon forthwith given that a general
and desperate assault upon the walls should be made
at sunrise of the morrow, as that would be the precise
moment when Tyrus&mdash;as one man&mdash;would be bent in
adoration to the visible God of Light. The wooden-towers
were to be secretly advanced during the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
to the walls,&mdash;as, also, the ponderous battering-rams;&mdash;the
former were to be filled with soldiery, so as to be
ready for instantly entering the city through any
breach, by lowering the tower drawbridges;&mdash;"crouching,"
like their ancestors, "in the ominous horse" at the
siege of Troy.</p>

<p>At midnight of the day preceding the Festival, the
devotional tribute to Apollo commenced in the Capital
by withdrawing from the walls the sentinels, citizens,
and all warlike defences,&mdash;for the day about to dawn
was dedicated to Nature, as a peace-offering upon the
Altar of their Deity.</p>

<p>Upon the walls being vacated, the Macedonians in
silence, and aided by the darkness of the night, placed
their battering-engines in position; advanced and filled
their scaling-towers; and made every preparation, unseen
and unheard, for the coming and dreadful event.</p>

<p>As the first indication of the break of day became
apparent, the Tyrian population, arrayed in their
gayest robes and attire (the garlands of their own sacrifice)
began to assemble, and concentrate towards the
great Temple of Hercules-Apollo;&mdash;its steps,&mdash;the vast
area in front,&mdash;and the broad avenues leading to the
Edifice of Religion, were filled and occupied with
masses of human beings, who, with their faces toward
"the East," stood ready to kneel and kiss the bosom of
their great mother,&mdash;Earth,&mdash;as the first beams of their
protecting God should descend upon them! The rising
of that Last Sun upon Tyrus was looked for with
breathless anxiety, both by the besieged and the invaders,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
former were gathered to offer their wild
thanks for their past safety,&mdash;for the present cessation
from hostilities, and devout prayers for their future
preservation,&mdash;for these solemn purposes were assembled
the Old and the Young,&mdash;Fathers with their
Sons,&mdash;Mothers and their infant Children,&mdash;Youths
and Virgins plighted in the spring-time of hope,&mdash;King,
Priests, the "Wise men," Warriors, and People
were gathered as with one heart&mdash;with one impulse,
to join in festive joy upon the Tyrian Sabbath of
the Year. But the foes to this scene of human happiness,
were crouched in ambush,&mdash;like the Serpent of
Eden,&mdash;and waited for that Sun's appearance as if it
had been the enemy of mankind, and were ready to
wreak their fury upon its children and worshippers!</p>

<p>At length the advancing heralds of Apollo were seen
bounding above the mountains of Damascus,&mdash;springing
with their gold-imbuing feet from cloud to cloud
until they reached the zenith,&mdash;when the Sun-God himself
appeared and approached from the mighty portals
of the East, arrayed in the gorgeous mantle of his
eternal throne! There was a moment of calm,
breathless intensity,&mdash;as before the hurricane;&mdash;then
arose the loud hosannahs from his Tyrian subjects,
now prostrate with adoration;&mdash;but they were answered
by the terrific and appalling shouts of the ambushed
Macedonians! Sudden as the storm-flash, a
breathless panic seized the kneeling worshippers;&mdash;they
were transfixed with fear, surprise, and wonder;&mdash;they
felt that their ever-faithful Deity had delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
them, bound in his own fetters, to the unsparing foe,&mdash;they
called aloud for his protection,&mdash;but the brow of
their God was suddenly shadowed by the clouds of an
approaching Tempest, indicating the war of elements as
of man;&mdash;the voice of supplication was now changed
to the wild language of despair,&mdash;all was horror and
confusion amid the Temples, Palaces, Courts, and
Streets of the Metropolis,&mdash;the screams and shrieks of
women and children, trodden underfoot by the frantic
and flying citizens, were unheard amid the demoniac
yells of the invaders, which even deadened the sound
of the distant and murmuring thunder: and they now
in their shouts of approaching triumph applied the
battering-engines with every energy and success,&mdash;for
the ramparts were unmanned, and their desperate
assault unchecked. The boldest of the Tyrians, recovering
from surprise, now rallied, and snatching up
weapons merely of attack (for their persons were defenceless
from their festival attire) flew towards the
wall, against which the impious attack was so furiously
rendered. It was too late,&mdash;an upper breach
had been made, and the soft stone wall was fast falling
beneath the repeated and ponderous blows of the battering
engines;&mdash;the balistæ and catapultæ were now
unmanned and overthrown as being useless, while the
giant towers were wheeled and levered toward the
breach, which now momentarily increased in width;
the several drop-bridges of the towers were instantly
lowered upon the battered walls, when the concealed
Soldiery, after their first discharge of arrows and javelins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
rushed like wolves from their dens upon the devoted
sheepfolds! As the towers, galleries, and hive-cells
were emptied, they were instantly replaced by
swarms of warriors from the camp, the whole of which
was now in motion. The hitherto inactive and impatient
Cavalry were drawn out and marshalled ready to
plunge like fierce dragons within the city, when the
crumbling walls should be partially levelled. The
bravest of the hardy Tyrians met the first storming
party (the forlorn-hope even of ancient days) with
dauntless courage, and kept in check, even by their
dead bodies, the instant advance of the foe;&mdash;the wall
was disputed inch by inch, and with increasing fury by
both parties,&mdash;each being resolved to conquer or to
die! While the conflict was raging on the walls,&mdash;where
the loud sounds and flashing weapons seemed
but the similitude of the over-hanging thunder and the
vivid lightning,&mdash;Azelmic, his Priests and body-guards,
prepared to protect their God and Temple to the last;
in their despair and wild devotion they took the golden
Statue of their Deity from its pedestal, and with massive
chains of the same metal to secure it, and with
huge nails driven through perforated holes in the feet,
they thus fastened it to the broad summit of the great
Altar of the Nation!</p>

<p>The devoted Sidonians were not inactive, for they
were watching the progress of the storming of the
walls, and as they learnt (from the shouts) that the invaders
were about to enter the city, they drew near,&mdash;<em>resolved
to receive at the Seaward Gates</em> those Fugitives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
who would rather choose a home within the
Galleys, than a grave within the Citadel.</p>

<p>The bloody contest at the storming point was terrible
in its effects, both upon the invaders and the besieged;
for the falling masses of stone buried in one
indiscriminate grave both friends and foes. At length,
the towers becoming useless from the walls being lowered
beneath the level of the drawbridges, they, with
the engines and machines were overthrown on either
side of the causeway, and the famed Macedonian
Phalanx passed the breach,&mdash;but the dead and dying,
with their upraised spears, and broken shafts in their
writhing bodies, formed for a time a barrier against the
advance of a division of horse,&mdash;they were recalled by
the shrill trumpets, while the pioneers levelled the
path of death;&mdash;a second troop of Infantry passed on
to the support of the first, who were now in desperate
conflict on the walls and breach with the opposing
ranks of the despairing Tyrians, many of whom empaled
themselves on the triple-spears of the Phalanx:&mdash;when
on a preconcerted signal from an upreared
flag (for the now loud thunder and deafening shouts
and shrieks deadened all trumpet-sounds to the distant
soldiery) the two battalions of Infantry on the ruins
opened to the right and left,&mdash;and Alexander,&mdash;mounted
on Bucephalus, and with the Standard inscribed
<em>Granicus</em>, just snatched from his banner-bearer,
and at the head of his Officers and Cavalry, flew like
"fiery Mars" to the summit of the breach! At that instant
a terrific flash rent the dark storm-clouds, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
shaft from the wild tempest struck to the ground the
marble Statue from the apex of the Temple,&mdash;the entablature
was sundered as by an earthquake! Alexander
at that moment,&mdash;with his bright corslet and
white-plumed helm reflecting back the lightning glare,&mdash;his
inspiring face and standard turned to his troops,&mdash;his
unsheathed and glittering sword pointing to the
foe,&mdash;his white and noble war-steed with storm-scattered
mane, and upreared head and feet, as if spurning
the dying bodies beneath his proud hoofs, yet feeling
his master's spirit, and anxious for the plunge amid the
living,&mdash;at that moment&mdash;Alexander appeared the
Hero of the World! He might have remained so,&mdash;but
the moment passed and for ever!&mdash;he descended,
as it were, from his moral elevation, like an avalanche
of crime upon the already blood-stained vale beneath!
His example was followed by Hephæstion, old Clytus,
Parmenio and the troop of future kings,&mdash;horsemen,&mdash;the
triple-guarded Phalanx,&mdash;cohorts of archers,&mdash;"the
whole camp, pioneers and all;"&mdash;fire, spear, and
sword were carried into every quarter of the capital.
While the Metropolis was wrapt in flames by the foot-soldiery,
and murdered women and children fell in
every street,&mdash;the Conqueror and his Cavalry attacked
the avenues leading to the Temple,&mdash;every pathway
to that Edifice was defended with a patriotic devotion,
and a Religious fanaticism!</p>

<p>While thus every passage was nobly defended, and
attention directed to those quarters, the few <em>Sidonian
Galleys</em> received on board their living freights,&mdash;<em>Families</em>,&mdash;<em>Men</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
<em>Women</em>, and <em>Children</em>,&mdash;cleared the
harbour unobserved, and upon the gradual lessening of
the storm of elements, they reached the open Sea in
safety:&mdash;Thus were the <em>Prophesied</em> "gleanings" of the
Nation rescued!</p>

<p>Azelmic, Priests, and People disputed with devoted
heroism the area to the Temple of the kingdom&mdash;it
was passed, but over the dead bodies of hundreds of
the defenders,&mdash;every step to the platform of the edifice
was dyed with human gore;&mdash;ascending the steps over
his crimson pathway, Alexander, followed by Hephæstion
and his favourites, reached the chief entrance,
through which Azelmic had rushed into the interior
of the Temple,&mdash;the Conqueror instantly dismounted
(followed by his officers), and pursued the apparent Fugitive,
in order to capture with his own hands the Monarch
of the Nation;&mdash;he entered the sacred court of
worship over the dead bodies of mangled priests,&mdash;when
suddenly the Standard of the Granicus dropped from
his hand, and was stained and effaced with sacrilegious
blood,&mdash;while himself and his officers fell back in Religious
awe, and were transfixed with heroic admiration!&mdash;for
the Last King of Tyrus, so far from retreating,
had sprung, sword in hand, upon the Altar of the
Nation,&mdash;and throwing his despairing arms around the
image of Apollo, resolved to defend&mdash;even to the
death&mdash;the enchained Statue of his Country and his
God!</p>

<p>Which was the Hero then?&mdash;the Patriot or the
Invader?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>So noble a picture of Patriotism, the Conqueror had
in vain looked for in the pages of the Iliad,&mdash;the inspiring
Volume to invasions and his victories. Amid
all the Sons of Priam and of Troy, there was not one
Azelmic;&mdash;and his true glory was indeed brilliant,
for Alexander's was dimmed and lost before it;&mdash;like
a Planet of the Night, when the star-discovering shade
of Earth, is dispelled by the dawning Sun!</p>

<p>The Patriot's life and liberty were granted by the
Conqueror, whose youth and native heroism sympathized
with such devoted and gallant bearing. Would
that the same mercy had been extended to the brave
Tyrians! The Capital had fallen,&mdash;but Conflagration
and wild Slaughter raged and ranged in every corner
of the Metropolis;&mdash;Massacre and Rapine roamed at
large unchecked by "pity or remorse,"&mdash;but sustained,
and hallooed on by the frantic yells of demoniac Revenge!
Thousands were slain in defending the walls,
streets, and Temples. Eight thousand Women and
Children fell by the sword alone, while nearly an equal
number were buried beneath the falling ruins, or perished
in the flames! Thirty-two thousand of the
inhabitants were made prisoners,&mdash;the walls were razed,
and every building burnt or levelled to the ground.
Thirty thousand of the captives were sold as slaves,
and dispersed into the Asiatic Countries. Alexander
then committed an act which should,&mdash;it has&mdash;"damned
him to everlasting fame,"&mdash;placed upon his once
bright shield, the canker-rust of infamy,&mdash;and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
must increase from the gathered curses of posterity!
After the surrender,&mdash;when even Slaughter and Rapine&mdash;the
scarlet sins of unrighteous war&mdash;had ceased
their havoc and brutality,&mdash;and the patriotic prisoners
were ranged and numbered,&mdash;this Demon of Macedonia
selected <em>two thousand</em> of the chief Citizens, and,
as if in mockery of their Goddess of the Nation&mdash;Astart&#275;,&mdash;whose
emblem was the <em>Cross</em>,&mdash;<em>commanded that
they should be Crucified</em>! It was accomplished,&mdash;the
setting Sun upon that Last Day of Tyrus, cast his
expiring gaze upon a Nation's Crucifixion! Avenues
of Crosses were upraised with frantic victims, along
the shores of the mainland; and in the streets of the
Isle,&mdash;or grouped upon the mounds of ruins, walls, and
Temples! Such an instance of cold-blooded barbarity
cannot be equalled in the annals of ancient crime,&mdash;except&mdash;<em>in
its repetition</em> by the same ruthless murderer,
after the patriotic defence of Oxus in India.</p>

<p>Alexander, as he stood upon the breached-wall of
Tyrus, could have been the Saviour of a People; but,
in his descent, he became like Lucifer,&mdash;a demon
devoted to passion and to crime! Let no voice applaud
him after he plunged from that wall,&mdash;the bloody stream
beneath was the Rubicon of his fame and glory;&mdash;he
passed it,&mdash;it could never be retraced. Oh! let no
author,&mdash;the instrument of Intellect&mdash;betray his high
duty and uphold the deeds of Invaders or Conquerors,
be they of the ancient or the modern world:&mdash;let him
stigmatize crime and injustice by their proper names,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
belong they to Macedonia, or to any other Nation
existing in our own times:&mdash;ay!&mdash;although the home
of our ancestors should be rebuked, for then only will
the hearths of their descendants be free from blame,
and avoid that desolation, which the contrary course
must (the North-Star is not more true) engender for
future time and action!&mdash;But, if the historic pen in its
duty to posterity, must be employed in recording the
annals of savage warfare and invasion, let it only
<em>praise</em> the true Patriots and Defenders of their Native-land,&mdash;be
they of remote antiquity in either hemisphere,&mdash;or
the Israel-warriors of Asiatic mountains,
snow-crowned Passes, or of the Vale of Cashmere;&mdash;the
noble and chivalric spirits of Circassia; the natives
of Algeria,&mdash;or the impotent People of that land,
claiming Confucius for its Philosopher,&mdash;where thousands
have been slain, and not one record made of the
desolated hearts of the Mother, Widow, or the Orphan!
Let us teach ourselves the truth,&mdash;open our own
hearts, and minds to receive the Religious impress of
its power,&mdash;ingraft it in the growing intellect of our
children, that they may, as a necessity, teach it to their
descendants,&mdash;that <em>one</em> Azelmic, or Montezuma,&mdash;Alfred,
or William Tell,&mdash;are worth the <em>entire host</em> of
Alexanders, Cortezes, Danish Conquerors, or tyrannic
Gieslers!</p>

<p>Our humble, yet fervent description of the Conquest
of Tyrus would fail of our hearted intent, if any other
sentiment than the above could be derived from it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
That terrible event was consummated on the 5th day
of Elul&mdash;the sixth month of the Hebrews and Ph&oelig;nicians;&mdash;which,
by the present computation of time,
would place the Destruction of the Tyrian Nation
upon the twentieth day of August, 332 years before
the Christian Æra.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE UNFOLDING OF THE NEWLY-APPLIED PROPHECIES
OF ISAIAH, AND THE PROOFS OF THEIR FULFILMENT.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">THE END OF CANAAN-TYRUS AS A NATION IN ASIA&mdash;CHARACTER
AND DEATH OF ALEXANDER&mdash;REFLECTIONS UPON CONQUERORS
AND PEACEMAKERS.</p></blockquote>


<p>Upon the accomplishment of the horrid massacre by
Alexander, Tyrus was indeed "utterly emptied and
utterly spoiled,"&mdash;for the King, Azelmic, was the only
human being having life and liberty of all the Tyrian
Kingdom,&mdash;excepting the "remnant" rescued by the
Sidonians. <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> in his Prophecy <em>foretold those two
facts</em>; and although we are aware that these new
truths of ancient history have never been applied to
that celebrated Prophecy, yet they are brought forward&mdash;even
if for the first time&mdash;with full and assured
conviction of the correctness of the present application.
We write with conscientious humility, yet with that
boldness arising from truth, founded upon a newly-discovered
fulfilment of a Scriptural Prophecy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> distinctly infers from the wording of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
vision, concerning the <em>second</em>, and final fall of Tyrus,
that the <em>King</em> should not be slain, or even be a prisoner,&mdash;but
that all the rest of the Nation (except the
"gleanings") should be swept away. These predictions
were actually accomplished, as shewn in the previous
chapter. Of the first two points, The Prophet
says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And it shall be, as with the <em>people</em>, so with the
<em>priest</em> [<small>KING</small>, is not mentioned]; as with the servant, so
with the master; as with the maid, so with her mistress;
as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with
the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of
usury, so with the giver of usury to him. The land
shall be <em>utterly emptied</em>, and <em>utterly spoiled</em>: for the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken this word." [xxiv.]</p>

<p>Now in <span class="smcap">Ezekiel's</span> Prophecy of the Siege of Tyrus
by Nebuchadnezzar, he not only foretels the fall of the
mainland City, but, also, of the "Prince" and "King of
Tyrus." Of, and to, the impious heir-apparent he is
authorized to exclaim,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Son of Man say unto the <em>Prince</em> of Tyrus, &amp;c.
Wilt thou yet say before him that <em>slayeth</em> thee, 'I am
a God?' but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in
the hand of him that slayeth thee. Thou shalt die
the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers,
for I have spoken it saith the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span>."</p>

<p>Of the reigning Monarch, Ithobalus the Second,
he uttered as follows: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Moreover the word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> came unto me,
saying, Son of man take up a lamentation upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
King of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord
God</span>: * * * I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay
thee before Kings that they may behold thee. * * *
All they that know thee among the people shall be
astonished at thee, thou shalt be a terror, and never
shalt thou be any more." [xxviii.]</p>

<p>The two last quotations from <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> belong to the
<em>first</em> Tyrian Siege. [485&mdash;472 <small>B. C.</small>] <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> prophesied
that after <em>that</em> destruction, the remaining People
should be forgotten as a Nation for 70 years,&mdash;they
were so; that they should then recover their strength,
and have commerce with every Country, and even
Jerusalem should be benefited by their merchandise.
This latter part is proved by the Judæan Prophet,
<span class="smcap">Nehemiah</span> [xxiii.], to have been fulfilled, while the
former portion is firmly established by authenticated
history.</p>

<p>If the patriotic King, Azelmic, had been ordained
to die at the <em>last</em> Siege of Tyrus, it is almost certain
that the manner of the Prophets would have been
adhered to by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, as it was subsequently by <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>,
who mentions that both "King" and "Prince" at
the first Siege should be destroyed, and they were so:&mdash;therefore,
the silence of <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> upon the subject of
Azelmic's death, may certainly be viewed as prophetical
of its <em>not</em> taking place at, or during, the final Siege;&mdash;but,
rather that he should survive his country's fall,&mdash;a
doom, to a pure patriot, more terrible than death.
Truly to feel that curse, the reader must peruse&mdash;if
the tearful eye will permit him&mdash;the Lamentations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> upon the Destruction of Jerusalem. The
same curse was endured by Azelmic.</p>

<p>The most sceptical upon the truths of Sacred Prophecy,
will be enforced to cast their doubts aside upon
contemplating the fulfilment of those by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, and
especially in regard to Tyrus,&mdash;for History has recorded
the fact that the King, Azelmic, was the only
being not slain, or sold to slavery (with the exception
stated), and even that "remnant" will be found to be
contemplated by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, upon a full investigation of
the great prediction. Every Christian reader, therefore,
will not doubt that any portion of the entire Prophecy
respecting Tyrus was fulfilled. The first two parts
of this newly-applied prediction have been given,&mdash;viz.,
that the Metropolis should, at the <em>second</em> Siege "<em>be utterly
emptied and utterly spoiled</em>," but that <em>the King
should not perish</em>. In the next chapter, the Prophecy
will be followed out to its full accomplishment, and the
Refugees in the Sidonian Galleys traced to their final
resting-place.</p>

<p>The history of Tyrus, as a nation of its own people,
in Asia, ceased upon the annihilation by Alexander.
He repopulated the site from the surrounding and
Grecian countries, and constituted as tributary monarch
the brave but unfortunate Azelmic. The Macedonian
having commanded that the Statue of Apollo should
be unchained from the Altar, he thereupon expressed
his gratitude to the golden Idol, for having sided with
him in his Conquest, by making the walls defenceless
upon the day of festival! After kneeling to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
Statue of the Tyrian Deity, he styled himself the
<em>Founder of Tyrus</em>! From thence he continued his
march towards Judæa, to punish the Jews for a supposed
assistance to the Tyrians; but, being flattered by
his reception as he approached the Capital, he at once
spared the city. He then received the celebrated Prophecy
of <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> concerning the "King of Grecia,"
from Jaddus, the High Priest of Jerusalem, upon
whose suggestion he offered a sacrifice in The Temple
to the <span class="smcap">Living God</span>! From the Holy-House of Judæa
he entered Egypt, and worshipped Jupiter-Ammon
both as Father and Deity! Such were the Religious
inconsistencies of the "Macedonian Madman," and
nothing but actual Insanity can reconcile such contrarieties,
and cruelties, in human character.</p>

<p>In the Nation of the Nile he was truly the Founder
of Alexandria (the name and site preserved to this
day), which city in progress of time outrivalled in
commercial prosperity the antecedent Capitals of
Sidon, Tyrus, and Carthage,&mdash;the triple and ill-fated
sisters from the Parent house of Canaan.</p>

<p>After his invasions and victories in India Alexander
was so much the victim of flattery, that he could even
deceive himself,&mdash;for it is recorded that he sighed or
wept for another world to conquer!&mdash;yet his torch and
war-spear were never thrown into the land of Italy,&mdash;and
the gates of Rome remained unseen and untouched
by the Macedonian Phalanx!</p>

<p>From that Circean goblet,&mdash;flattery,&mdash;when presented
by Cassander, the Conqueror little dreamed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
it could contain the subtle and his deadly poison;&mdash;but
the agony of his own death-struggle was but the emblem
of that which he had caused millions of human
beings to endure,&mdash;and whose only crime in the eyes
of the invader was, that they had defended their native
lands!</p>

<p>Why should Historians condemn an Attila or a
Cortez, and yet applaud their great Original? They
pass by the Tyrian Hiram or Azelmic unhonoured, yet
style an Alexander,&mdash;"the Great!" One Mediator for
Peace must be, in the eyes of <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;upon His great
principle of love and good-will to all,&mdash;more acceptable
at the Final Day, than all the Legions of unrepenting
Conquerors of the past, the present, or the
future.</p>

<p>The false fame of Alexander, or of Cortez will not,
in the estimation of posterity, be even compared in
true value with the practical disciples of Peace; who,
like an Ashburton and Daniel Webster, have created
a new æra in policy and civilization, and that too
without tarnishing their radiant National honour,&mdash;but
rather increasing its already dazzling splendour, and
with it&mdash;elevating the Religious and moral dignity of
humanity!</p>

<p>In the sacred words of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, "Blessed are the
Peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of
<span class="smcap">God</span>!"</p>

<p>For the continued glory and character of the British
Throne, and the Curule Chair of the Anglo-Saxon
Republic;&mdash;as an enviable example to posterity;&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
for the increasing Amity between the two great Nations
represented by the Treaty of Washington, may that
Document, founded in the highest principles of Christianity,
be sealed and mottoed by the hand of GOD
Himself,&mdash;<small>ESTO PERPETUA</small>!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>(332 <small>B. C.</small>)</h3>

<p class="center">
THE FLIGHT OF THE TYRIAN FAMILIES<br />

AT<br />

THE FALL OF TYRUS.<br />

&amp;c.<br />

THE FIVE ADDITIONAL AND NEWLY-APPLIED<br />

TYRIAN PROPHECIES OF ISAIAH<br />

INVESTIGATED AND ESTABLISHED:</p>


<p class="center">(<em>Making, with the Two generally acknowledged,&mdash;Seven in all:</em>)</p>

<p class="center">THE LAST, APPLICABLE ONLY TO ANCIENT AMERICA.
</p>


<p>That we may be distinctly understood in the numbering
of the Sacred Prophecies by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, having reference
to Tyrus, we will briefly review them: and at
the same time we repeat, that they are not required to
sustain the present History,&mdash;they are, however, the
seals to the Document.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">1st Prophecy.</span></p>

<p>This we understand to be the same as foretold by
<span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> and <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>,&mdash;viz., the destruction of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
metropolis on the <em>mainland</em> by Nebuchadnezzar. This
event was accomplished at the end of the thirteen
years' siege, 485-472 <small>B. C.</small></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">2d Prophecy.</span></p>

<p>This was that the "Daughter of Sidon," as a Nation,
should be forgotten <em>seventy years</em>, and then be
restored to memory and power. This was fulfilled,&mdash;reckoning
from the commencement of the Babylonian
investment (for she then ceased to be free) to the Dedication
of the Second Temple at Jerusalem, in the rebuilding
of which the Tyrians again assisted, as in the
days of Hiram and Solomon.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">3d Prophecy.</span></p>

<p>The third (and with those that follow now originally
applied) had reference to a <em>second</em> destruction,&mdash;the
prediction stated that "the land should be utterly
emptied, and utterly spoiled." This fearful prediction
was consummated by Alexander, in taking the Island-Capital,
and by his massacre of the population.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">4th Prophecy.</span></p>

<p>This enumerates the several classes of the inhabitants
at Tyrus during <em>the last siege</em>, and that all (save
the exception in the next Prophecy) should be slain or
made captive, found within the walls, but the King,&mdash;he
is the solitary exception, and that this was fulfilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
is proved from classic history, and which we have endeavoured
to illustrate in the previous chapter.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">5th Prophecy.</span></p>

<p>This distinctly states that a "remnant" of the nation
should be rescued from the Alexandrian destruction.
The prediction is comprehended in the following words
of <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>:</p>

<p>"In the city is left desolation [<em>i. e.</em> massacre], and
the gate is smitten with destruction [<em>i. e.</em> with the
storming]. When <small>THUS</small> it shall be in the midst of the
land among the people, there shall <em>be as the shaking
of an olive-tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the
vintage is done</em>."</p>

<p>These figures of speech from many proofs in Scripture
(as previously given, Vol. i., Book ii., ch. v.), mean
that <em>a Remnant shall be saved</em>. This was fulfilled,&mdash;through
the instrumentality of the friendly Sidonians,
as already shewn. This is, also, on the authority of
acknowledged history,&mdash;though Arrian in merely alluding
to the fact, has, of course, no reference to any fulfilment
of Prophecy, of which it may be presumed that
he was entirely ignorant as to its existence,&mdash;or if not,
he had no belief in its sacred character; but neither of
these points destroy the record of the fact of the
Sidonians having rescued the "remnant" during the
Siege.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">6th Prophecy.</span></p>

<p>This foretels the <em>means</em> of escape to be employed
by the last of the Tyrians,&mdash;that it should be by <em>navigation</em>,
not by land;&mdash;this is gathered conclusively
from the lines immediately following the preceding
quotation, wherein the natural thanksgiving upon such
an escape is also expressed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They [the remnant] shall lift up their voices, they
shall sing aloud <em>from the</em> <span class="smcap">Sea</span>!" (<em>i. e.</em> Mediterranean.)</p>

<p>The proof of the fulfilment of this Prophecy is the
same as that employed to establish the previous one,&mdash;viz.,
the Sidonian Galleys.</p>

<p>The four predictions (3d, 4th, 5th, 6th) having reference
to the Alexandrian Siege of Tyrus, distinctly
foretels as follows: viz.&mdash;The storming of the capital&mdash;the
massacre,&mdash;the safety of the King,&mdash;and of the
King only within the walls. While these points were
in action,&mdash;a remnant,&mdash;a nation's gleaning,&mdash;should
be safely gathered,&mdash;that they should be rescued by
the means of navigation,&mdash;that they should lift their
voices in thanksgiving "from the sea,"&mdash;which as a
mother, upon her bosom was to cherish them in safety!
Now all these Prophecies, and their several parts, are
proved by authenticated history to have been accomplished;&mdash;no
sceptic, therefore, in regard to the startling
character (perhaps boldness) of this History, can
deny to the Author the right to claim and employ a
<em>seventh</em> and a last Prophecy by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
conclusions of Tyrian identity in the Western Hemisphere.
This last prediction refers even to the character
of the Voyage to be finally taken by the fugitive
"remnant,"&mdash;the great distance of their flight,&mdash;and
that when they had reached their destination they
should sojourn there.</p>

<p>This conclusive Prophecy will be brought forward
in its proper place. The Sidonians and rescued Tyrians
now claim attention.</p>

<p>At the moment when the Capital was being desolated
by flame and falchion, and when the walls and
gates were "smitten with destruction," the Sidonian
Galleys received on board the fugitive Families; and
from the direct National act of friendship, it must appear
apparent that those saved, Men, Women, and Children,
were Tyrians only;&mdash;yet in the confusion, a few
Greeks and Egyptians may have found shelter. This
is possible in reference to individuals (but not to families);
for Tyrus being in commercial intercourse with
the Nile and the Archipelago, may have contained
some few inhabitants of Egypt or Greece at the sacking
of the City. Amid the noise attendant upon the entrance
of the Macedonian Soldiery, and the screams of
the affrighted populace, the Sidonian vessels, with their
fearful freights escaped unobserved by the invaders; or,
if they had been seen by the enemy, they would not
have been pursued; for they were Sidonians,&mdash;not
Tyrians,&mdash;that is in outward appearance, as manifested
by the colours, or ensigns of their Galleys; and to avoid
suspicion, their ships must have been few,&mdash;five or six,&mdash;sufficient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
however, for the conveyance of "a Colony
from the East."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Thus escaped, and upon the broad and friendly
"Sea," it will readily be imagined that Tyrian prayers
and thanksgivings were "lifted up" in purity and sincerity.
Upon leaving Tyrus, they rowed towards the
open waters of the Mediterranean; but keeping in-shore,
and for the approaching nightfall, their prows
would be turned toward the West. The first sunset of
their flight may have been crimsoned with the tints of
Nature,&mdash;but towards the East, on the horizon of their
once-loved home, arose the red clouds from furious
conflagration,&mdash;their fallen and flaming dwellings
quenched only in the flowing and heated streams of
human blood!</p>

<p>As Night struggled for supremacy with expiring
Day, the sky and waters were illumined from the
raging fire, rising from the funeral pile of an once
mighty, but now prostrate nation. The Tyrian "Queen of
the Sea," now dressed in her last crimson robe (which
like that of Hercules festered her to madness), from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
Island-throne cast her expiring looks upon the Mediterranean,&mdash;her
faithful, yet conquered champion,&mdash;whose
bright panoply reflected and increased the grandeur
of the Monarch's fall&mdash;which, like a Star falling
from the purple dome of Night, and its fiery train reflected
on the Ocean, and both on the same instant, as
in sympathy, expire: so the Sea-girt Queen's&mdash;and, like
that Star, cast from the Pleiades of Nations&mdash;never to
be found in her own, but in <em>another</em> Sphere!</p>

<p>The last of the Tyrian Sons and Daughters, who,
from the Sidonian decks now gazed, like wildered maniacs,
upon the smouldering ruins of their home and
country, and heard in the gathering stillness of the
night, the accumulated groans of the Crucified victims,
and could perceive in the rising moonlight (now emitting
its full-orbed splendour) their naked and writhing
bodies, which, reflected like images of ivory in the
placid waters of the shore, seemed to double the horrors
of the scene;&mdash;while some of the Crucified upon the
high ruins of the City, had wrenched the nails and
cords of their hands from their dire scaffolds, and were
plunging headlong, grasping in air, and calling upon
their gods to end their torture: yet, even with this
maddening scene before them, they felt that the fates
of those that had perished by the flame, sword, or
Cross, were enviable when compared with their <em>living</em>
desolation! In their moments of misery, they experienced
in its full force, the baneful curse cast upon the
Children through the Parent's pride and policy! Like
Ishmael, Abram's first-born, their hands had been uplifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
against every Nation; and in return, every hand
was raised against <em>them</em>. They were now wanderers&mdash;not
like Hagar,&mdash;of a wilderness, where by a Well of
Life an Angel of Mercy might appear; but upon an
approaching dark and stormy Sea; the harbours and
fountains of humanity closed against them, and surrounded
on every hand by the demons of despair or
death! As they in their "palmy state" had rejoiced
upon the Destruction of Jerusalem, so <em>their</em> Nation's fall
became the mirth and triumph to every country; and
they, in their turn, reached their summit of grandeur,
and from thence descended to desolation!</p>

<p>The Fugitives were now upon the Sea,&mdash;but no harbour
could receive them: the pilots dare not return
and land at Sidon, for the agents and officers of Alexander,
and his own King were there, to protect the
Treaty, and his interest: to land the Tyrians, therefore,
at their parental home, would have involved that
nation in a ruin similar, if not equal, to that of Tyrus,
the horrors of which had struck a terror to the World!
Some Historians of the ancient days have supposed that
the Fugitives were taken to Sidon, because, <em>they were
nowhere to be found</em>!&mdash;but those writers,&mdash;and Raleigh
within the walls of the Tower,&mdash;may be well excused,
for they knew not of Temple-ruins, and walls of equal
magnitude, being in existence in another Hemisphere.</p>

<p>The next, and only apparent City of refuge was self-protecting
Carthage: but the Senate of that Republic
had refused to aid the Tyrians even in their day of
strength; and Alexander's march upon Jerusalem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
resent a supposed offence of the Jews, in rendering assistance
to Tyrus, would be another reason, conjoined
with the sending of Rhodanus, why Carthage would
not receive them. The Tyrians, however, may have
been furnished, indirectly, with supplies for a voyage at
Carthage,&mdash;<em>bought by the Sidonians, the owners of the
Galleys</em>; and in this instance no offence could be entertained
by the agents of the Macedonian, who were
watching his interests in the Republic.</p>

<p>In this terrible dilemma, there was but one Oasis in
the watery Desert, and that was the Tyrian's by right
of original discovery; <em>this was the group of Islands first
landed upon by their Ancestors</em>, in their circumnavigation
of the Continent of Africa; and which are designated
by <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>, as "the Isles which are <em>beyond</em>
the Sea." To these truly "Fortunate Islands" it was
but natural that the Last of the Tyrians would turn
their thoughts. Since the Alexandrian Deluge which
had overwhelmed their country, in the Sidonian Arks
they had floated above the dangers of the flood; but,
like the ravens of the Deluge, they had wandered to
and fro, hopeless of return: yet their dove of peace,
which at first could find "no rest for the sole of her
foot," now brought to their "mental sight" an olive-leaf
from their Island-Ararat "beyond the Sea!"</p>

<p>With heavy hearts, it may be supposed, that they
bade farewell for ever to the Mediterranean. Passing
through the Straits of Gibraltar, and coasting along the
western shores of Africa, the snow-crowned Peak of
the chief Island would rise from the Ocean, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Pharos to illumine and proclaim their path of present
safety. The peculiar circumstances causing these lands
to be revisited by the Tyrians, would (as before hinted)
seem to point directly to the reason of their original
and ancient appellation,&mdash;viz., The <em>Fortunate</em> Isles
(Fortunatæ Insulæ). The name, from its very definition,
indicates a place of refuge from foe or wreck, and
is, therefore, directly applicable to the Fugitives. Upon
the <em>chief</em> of the Islands, known in modern times as
Teneriffe, the Tyrians and Sidonians first landed. We
establish this apparent fact, upon the ground that the
principal burying-place was here, as proved by the
Mummies discovered in the caverns of the Peak, as
stated in the Analogies, and the same species being
found in Peru. They form a distinct and absolute
chain across the Atlantic, uniting the Fortunate Isles
with the Western Hemisphere! [Vol. i., Book i.,
ch. vii., § 4.] The other Islands of the group were
inhabited at a later day, and without doubt by the
Sido-Tyrian descendants, who became a People known
as the Guanches, <em>i. e.</em> Freemen; the name itself (as
before stated) points to an escape from Slavery.</p>

<p>After the Tyrians had landed on the Fortunate Isle,
the events of the past would soon compel them to
give full consideration to the probabilities, and even
possibilities of the future. These causes of the hopes
and fears of the human family, may have produced the
effects of assurance and conviction in their distracted
minds, that their escape was known,&mdash;the pathway of
their retreat had been tracked,&mdash;and that the remorseless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
bloodhound of Macedonia would still pursue them, not
only for their lives, but for the lands that had received
them. Again:&mdash;their new home might be discovered
by some of the citizens of Sidon, following in search of
their absent countrymen: or if the Sidonians on the
Fortunate Isle should return to the Mediterranean, discovery
might be conveyed in that manner; and that
they would return was apparent, for they had left their
families at Sidon. Every point of conclusion would
force upon them the necessity of further retreat from
still surrounding dangers: and that their next home as
a Nation must be founded upon the "gleanings" of their
own country, unconnected with the noble Sidonians,
except by a companionship. The only means for further
retreat were in possession of their present friends,&mdash;viz.,
The Galleys. The Island which they now inhabited,
and those surrounding them, belonged to the
Tyrians,&mdash;a free gift of which by the owners, in exchange
for the Galleys of the Sidonians (save one for
their own return to Sidon), would naturally occur to
the parties, under the peculiar circumstances in which
they were now relatively placed. It will readily be
admitted that the Sidonians, having hazarded their
lives, and even the destruction of their country, in
"gleaning" from the carnage at Tyrus, the "remnant"
of the People, that they would not hesitate to grant
them the means of perfect safety. The Galleys, therefore,
may have become the Tyrian property by gift,
purchase, or in exchange for the Islands,&mdash;and perhaps,
the National secret of the Tyrian Dye: either of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
propositions, without the employment of "force," must
appear probable, and especially the two latter. We
gather the suggestion of the Secret of the "Dye" being
one of the "objects" in the "negotiation" from the fact
that the <em>Shell</em> is in the hands of the Negotiators, represented
upon the Altar at Copan,&mdash;the City we have
placed as having been the first built in Ancient
America,&mdash;the Sculpture of which identically illustrates
this act of Amity!</p>

<p>The Tyrian possession of the vessels being accomplished,
it would be natural that the Sidonians would
return to their homes, before the departure of the rescued,
1st, From the natural desire to return to their own
families; 2dly, To prevent the enemy's suspicion from
delay; and 3dly, They would be enabled, thereby, to
again serve the Tyrians, by throwing any pursuers off
the true track; and to these points may be added, the
National Secretiveness of the "Daughter of Sidon," who
might wish to conceal her retreat even from her protecting
Parent. Whether the Sidonians left first or not,
or whether the parties left simultaneously, is of no materiality
towards the firm establishing of the truth of
this History: but, the apparent facts of the case would
force the conclusion, that if they did not lower oars
simultaneously, they would leave the Tyrians in possession
of the Isles, which they (the Sidonians) would
return to at an early period to occupy; and that they
did, the ancient sepulchres, and their contents, bear
ample testimony, for the Religious customs of Sidonians
and Tyrians were identical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sidonians had now placed the last seal upon
their bond of friendship. It was deeply impressed upon
the mind of the receiver, and could never be forgotten,
or razed from the tablet of Tyrian memory! It was
truly a subject for the Sculptor's art to perpetuate, not
only upon their Temples, but upon the "Chief Altar"
in whatever land or country their future fate should
cast them. And such we believe to be the subject of
the Sculpture upon the Chief Altar of Copan in Ancient
America, erected by Gratitude as a Religious Tribute
to Friendship; that whenever they should bow in reverence
to their visible God, they should remember
the parental act, which alone had enabled them to offer
praises to their Deity! The Sidonians in their departure
for their home upon the Mediterranean, must have
received the united blessings of a People, who through
their means only, had been rescued from desolation or
death, and in the terrible forms of Conflagration or
Crucifixion.</p>

<p>The Last of the Tyrian Nation, the remnant of an
once powerful People, were about to trust themselves
again upon that element which had ever befriended
them,&mdash;and upon which they had ever moved as the
Lords of the domain: but, they had now no merry
metropolis to receive them,&mdash;no walled citadel whose
antiquity would speak to them of "ancient days:"
recollections of the past were terrible,&mdash;the anticipations
of the future were dark and uncertain,&mdash;and in
the present time only could they view security. To
return to any known part of Asia, Africa, or Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
was impossible,&mdash;their only path from the Fortunate
Isle was forth upon an untracked Ocean. Their final
landing-place might be afar off,&mdash;their sojourn for ever;&mdash;but
Apollo and Astart&#275;, their imaged orbs of Day
and Night, were to be the "lanterns to their feet,"&mdash;and
their skilful knowledge, would shelter them beneath
the gorgeous, and star-gemmed mantle of Astronomy!</p>

<p>The reader now may naturally inquire, How does this
position and resolution of the Tyrians agree with "a
<em>seventh</em> and last Prophecy," alluded to in the commencement
of this Chapter as being now newly applied?&mdash;and
what is that Prophecy by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>?</p>

<p>The answers will be given with firmness, from the
conscientious conviction of their truth. Those natural
points of debate in the minds of the Tyrians, were the
preliminaries to the fulfilment,&mdash;and their safe landing
and sojourn in the Western Hemisphere, were the
actual accomplishment of the Prophecy!</p>

<p>The prediction may have been unknown to this
remnant of a Nation,&mdash;for it was uttered to the Jewish
people, and by one of that great family,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>,&mdash;and
nearly 400 years previous to the Alexandrian Siege.
The Sacred Prophet distinctly says, [xxiii. 7]&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Howl, ye inhabitants of the Isle!</em> [Tyrus] <em>Is this
your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days?</em>"</p>

<p>This sentence by its question is spoken as <em>to</em> the
Tyrians;&mdash;but the line immediately following, was
uttered as <em>of</em> them, and from the wording, from the
very spirit of a pre-knowledge of a future event!&mdash;viz.,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Her own feet shall carry her</span> [Tyrus] <span class="smcap">afar
off to sojourn</span>!"</p>

<p>This Prophetic line (brief as it is) contains four distinct
and important parts, yet each as necessary to the
whole, as quadruple angles to the perfection of a
square: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Her own feet | shall carry her | afar off | to sojourn."</p>

<p>1st. "<em>Her own feet</em>,"&mdash;is figurative that the means
should be Tyrian; viz., Navigation.</p>

<p>2d. "<em>Shall carry her</em>," <em>i. e.</em> shall convey them,&mdash;and
that it was to be by Navigation has already been
proved,&mdash;"they shall cry aloud from <em>the Sea</em>"&mdash;that
is also demonstrated by the Galleys of the Sidonians.</p>

<p>3d. "<em>Afar off</em>"&mdash;figurative that the migration should
be to some unusual distance, or nameless land.</p>

<p>4th. "<em>To sojourn</em>," <em>i. e.</em> to reside or remain,&mdash;and as
no time or duration is affixed to the words, they would
seem to express in the language of the Bible&mdash;"to
sojourn for evermore," or to a time wherein total annihilation
should be accomplished,&mdash;as it has been by
the Spaniards and their descendants.</p>

<p>We will meet at the threshold any objections to
the strong and conclusive application to this History,
of this remarkable, and hitherto unemployed line of
Prophecy.</p>

<p>1st. It cannot belong to the <em>first</em> Siege of Tyrus,&mdash;viz.,
by Nebuchadnezzar,&mdash;for after that event, the
remnant of the then Conquered People left the mainland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
Metropolis, and <em>settled on the Island</em>,&mdash;a distance
of <em>less than half a mile</em>; therefore, "afar off to sojourn"
could not apply to that invasion.</p>

<p>2dly. Being admitted that the line does not apply
to the Babylonian destruction, then as a necessity, it
must belong to that by the Macedonian Monarch. The
Sidonians upon that occasion rescued the remnant of
the Nation, and to have returned to Sidon would also
not be "afar off," as the distance from Tyrus is but
<em>twenty-three miles</em>. We apprehend, also, that the
reader is convinced that the political reasons for not
returning to Sidon are apparent and conclusive.</p>

<p>3dly. The Tyrians, simply by obtaining the Galleys
from the friendly Sidonians, had as it were their "own
feet," <em>i. e.</em> navigable means to carry them,&mdash;for Tyrus
itself had <em>stood</em>, or <em>walked</em> firmly for centuries, only
through and by means of Navigation.</p>

<p>And 4thly. They were not only to journey or migrate
to "afar off" distance,&mdash;a land as yet not <em>known
by name</em>, and therefore, <em>could not</em> be specified by
<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>;&mdash;but another condition, or incident is affixed,&mdash;viz.,
that wherever they finally landed, there they
were "to sojourn." Now let the most scrutinizing,
Argus-eyed antiquary, search every quarter of Europe,
Asia, or Africa,&mdash;their ancient or their modern histories, or
traditions (and we know them well), and where
will he find these "afar off" sojourners, contemplated
by the Prophet <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>? The conclusive answer to such
inquiry will be, as from the Tomb of Time, "Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
shalt not find them;"&mdash;but, in Ancient America, there
they are traceable,&mdash;there they are found;&mdash;proved to
be identical with the Tyrians of Ph&oelig;nicia,&mdash;and the
truth of the long-concealed Prophecy, established by
Holy-Writ and new-discovered History.</p>

<p>"Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn," is
a sentence too positive in its construction to be viewed
by any reader as an idle or a careless expression by
<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>. The solemn occasion upon which it was
uttered,&mdash;viz., the prediction of a Nation's downfall,&mdash;utterly
repudiates even the supposition that it, as part
of the great Prophecy, should not be strictly fulfilled
with the residue; and every other part having been accomplished,
it would be sophistry to assume that this
particular line should not be:&mdash;but such an assumption
would not hold, since its fulfilment is absolutely proved
in the Southern portion of Ancient America.</p>

<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<p class="center">"THE MEANS AND APPLIANCES" FOR THE VOYAGE.</p>

<p>In the endeavour to establish the fact contemplated
by the title of this chapter, it will be necessary to bring
to the memory of the reader some of the material
points having reference to the Voyage around the continent
of Africa. [Vol. i., Book ii., ch. vi., § 2.] Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
points of proof will be given, and for convenience in
numerical order.</p>

<p>1st. <em>The Galleys.</em> The larger Galleys were double-masted,
and they had not only the large square sails
which were exactly suited for running before the
wind, from their central and balanced position; but
they had also the powerful adjunct of the Rowers,
whose services were rendered with or without reference
to the assistance of the sails. The extraordinary
power of the Rowers is recorded by nearly
every ancient Historian, and from Scripture we have
the character of their strength and fearlessness, especially
of the Tyrians. <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> writes in his description
of Tyrus,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And thy Rowers have brought thee into great
waters."</p>

<p>The fitness or the capacity of the Galleys will not be
questioned, when thought is given to the previous expedition
around Africa, and especially at the doubling
of the Cape of Good Hope, which is far more dangerous
than crossing the Atlantic.</p>

<p>2d. <em>The locality of the Fortunate Isles</em> (<em>i. e.</em> Canaries).
This is important. These are situated on the
North-West coast of Africa, in the Atlantic ocean, and
<em>within</em> thirty degrees of North latitude, and, consequently,
directly under the influence of the celebrated
Easterly Wind.</p>

<p>3d. <em>The East-Wind, and its proof of the truth of
History.</em> The reader will remember the detailed account
given of this constant current of air, in the sixth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
chapter of this book. [Vol. i., Book ii., ch. vi., § 2.]
We may, however, be permitted to repeat, that it
blows perpetually from East <em>to</em> West, consequently
over and from the Fortunate Isles <em>directly towards
America</em>,&mdash;those Islands being within the degrees over
which this orient gale has, and will for ever pass.</p>

<p>The direct opposite land to these Islands, on the
American Continent, is Florida, it being, like the Isles,
within the thirty degrees North latitude. Now any
vessel or Galley to set sail before the wind from Teneriffe
(the Isle upon which the Tyrians were), and place
the rudder or helm fore and aft (<em>i. e.</em> not obliquely,
but central), then the East-Wind would drive that
vessel <em>directly on to Florida</em>. This fact is not more
certain (as the map will prove) than the historical
tradition of the Mexican Aborigines is extraordinary
in reference to this fact, and to the original Theory
forming the basis of this volume.</p>

<p>We stated in the Analogies, and it is now repeated
with peculiar force and interest, that the Spanish Historian,
Sahagan, who lived on friendly terms with the
Aborigines for sixty years, and wrote only fifteen years
after the Cortezian Conquest (1520), relates, that on
the authority of Montezuma the Emperor, and his
People, and the tradition from the remotest times,&mdash;handed
down from sire to son,&mdash;and also from their
historical paintings,&mdash;that their ancestors, as a colony,
<em>first touched at Florida</em>!&mdash;that they crossed or coasted
the Gulf of Mexico and Yucatan, and then finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
landed and settled <em>somewhere in the Bay of Honduras</em>!
Now the <em>Copan</em> river is a branch of the Montagua,
which empties itself into the Bay of Honduras!</p>

<p>The reader will not be more startled at the above
historic facts than was the present author at their discovery;
for he had already formed in his mind (sanctioned
by Prophecy) the Tyrian Æra of this History <em>before</em>
his research brought to light this direct evidence from
Sahagan,&mdash;whose accuracy of relation is, in this instance,
on a level with Herodotus,&mdash;for both accounts
are proved to be true by that powerful and incorruptible
witness&mdash;Nature! The shadow of the Tyrians
as a necessity changed from left to right in crossing the
Equatorial line of the Indian Ocean;&mdash;and the East-Wind
would compel the Galleys in coming from "the
East," and upon sailing due West from Teneriffe, to
"touch at Florida." The statement of Sahagan is the
more valuable from the fact that it was not given to
establish or forward any historic Theory, but like the
words of Herodotus given only as a truth,&mdash;related by
those of whom he was writing. "Somewhere in the
bay of Honduras" brings the final place of landing (as
stated) near the locality of Copan. We had already,
from analyzing the ruins and altar, placed that city in
our plan as being the <em>first</em> built in Ancient America.
It was an additional source of confirmation to our
artistical judgment in regard to the arrangement of the
architectural data of the Ruins, when the tradition of
the Aborigines, as given by Sahagan, was, that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
ancestors finally landed "in the Bay of Honduras,"
and consequently on passing up the Montagua, the Tyrians
would approach to the direct locality of Copan!</p>

<p>Taking the statement of the Spaniard, therefore, to
be a fact (sustained as it is by nature) in relation to
the place <em>first</em> landed on or "touched" by the Aborigines,&mdash;viz.,
Florida,&mdash;another strange incident is arrived
at,&mdash;viz., that Columbus must have followed
nearly the identical track of the Tyrians,&mdash;for the same
East-Wind propelled his vessels, and himself and crew
expressed their wonder and astonishment at its continuance;
and it is an authenticated fact that he first
lauded at St. Salvador (<em>i. e.</em> Cat Island). Now the
Fortunate Isles, St. Salvador, and the first point
"touched at Florida," are all within thirty degrees
North latitude, and nearly on an exact line with each
other,&mdash;St. Salvador and Florida Point are directly so,
and only about 100 leagues from each other. The
Tyrians, therefore, passed by this Island and landed
on the Continent,&mdash;Columbus landed on the Island,
and reached the Continent in his third voyage.</p>

<p>4th. <em>The collective means for the Migration.</em> Under
this head may be included the "appliances" of both
Art and Nature. Their Galleys were of sufficient
strength and capacity,&mdash;their provisions ample,&mdash;derived
from Carthage, the Sidonians, and the fruitful
Isle of Teneriffe: their skill and courage as Pilots,
Mariners, and Rowers unequalled,&mdash;the season of the
year propitious, and a constantly favourable wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
and flowing sea (although to them unknown as such)
of sufficient power to drive them quickly westward,
and compel them to reach the "afar off" land "to
sojourn."</p>

<p>5th. <em>The probable time and duration of the Voyage.</em>
The remnant of the Tyrian Nation, through the instrumentality
of the Sons of Sidon, escaped from their
naming Capital, August 20th [332 <small>B. C.</small>], and in allowing
for time in reaching the Fortunate Isles, and
preparing for their departure thence, it will, we think,
be acceded that by October of the same year, and the
equinoctial gales of the autumn having then passed,
opened to them "fair weather ahead,"&mdash;they were
then prepared to seek another home, however distant.
The strong Galleys, with sails and oars, and always before
the constant East-Wind and onward wave-current,
would accomplish ten miles an hour by day, and
during the night, without the Rowers, six miles an
hour, and equally dividing the twenty-four hours,
would make a run of 192 miles per day. Nautical
proofs will shew that in the above calculation the
power of the Trade-Winds [<em>i. e.</em> the East-Winds] are
<em>underrated</em>. The distance from Teneriffe to Florida is
about 3300 miles, which by the foregone data they
would traverse in seventeen and a quarter days. The
Voyage may therefore with safety be said to have been
accomplished during an entire month, and that, consequently
the first landing of a branch of the human family
in Ancient America would be in the last month of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Autumn, three hundred and thirty-two years before
the Christian Æra.</p>

<p>And 6th. <em>The Fugitive Founders of</em> (what we
think may now be justly termed) <em>Tyrian-America</em>,
<em>i. e.</em> the Southern moiety of the Continent.</p>

<p>The Female portion of the Fugitives were in all probability
(from the peculiar character of the rescue) the
Wives, Sisters, and Daughters, of the Tyrian Husbands,
Brothers, and Fathers, who escaped with them,&mdash;thus
forming a "colony,"&mdash;and if there were among them
any Strangers or Orphans from the general carnage,
protection would naturally be given, as to companions
and children of misery and misfortune.</p>

<p>The Fugitives being Tyrians, and of the great Sidonian
family, which, in the language of Homer, comprehended
every thing that was ingenious and accomplished,
to the exclusion of their opposites, puts us at
once in possession of the distinct <em>intellectual</em> character
of those about to seek another land; and where, after
2000 years have passed, Time removes his veil of
mystery, and discovers the truth of the Homeric tribute,&mdash;while
over their Asiatic home of a more ancient
day, Oblivion with her Lethean flood, has swept even
their epitaph and their tomb away!</p>

<p>As to the number of the Tyrian Fugitives (more or
less), it is immaterial to the proof, or denial, of the
truth of this historical work,&mdash;for nothing is so deceptive,
and yet so certain, as the numerical demonstration
in regard to population, and of the human beings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
that have lived. For instance,&mdash;the reader will scarcely
believe, that in tracing back his own family only <em>twenty-five</em>
generations, there were then living <em>at that time</em>, sixty-seven
millions, one hundred and eight thousand, eight
hundred and sixty-four of his Ancestors,&mdash;and that
there had lived, <em>during</em>, and <em>at</em> that time, one hundred
millions, six hundred and sixty-three thousand, three
hundred and ninety-six! These apparent incredible
results are instantly proved upon the following data of
facts and argument; viz., each child must have two parents,
each parent had two,&mdash;and so on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>,&mdash;the
result is, therefore, obtained by simply multiplying by
two, from each of the first Father and Mother, and then
add them together, and each sum total will represent
a generation,&mdash;the 25th will give the first result,&mdash;viz.,
67,108,864;&mdash;to ascertain <em>all</em> that have lived <em>during</em>,
and at that period,&mdash;the several sums total must be
added together, which will prove the second result,&mdash;viz.,
100,663,396. Therefore,&mdash;by the data of this
last calculation the 30th generation only, in the ancestral
line, has the following result,&mdash;3,221,228,672!&mdash;(and this
but of <em>one</em> person) four times as much as the present
population of the Globe, which is estimated at
800,000,000. The great earthly Monarch, Death,
has indeed an empire of his own!</p>

<p>The metaphysical, or anti-Biblical reader will find
in the above results, a high theme for speculative reasoning:&mdash;but
in tracing back to the Parents of Eden,
or to the Diluvian Æra, in order to <em>sustain</em>, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
deny, the truth of the Bible, he must remember that,&mdash;but,
no,&mdash;we will not anticipate our own secret for
unravelling the above sphinx-like conclusions.</p>

<p>In the next Volume, devoted to the Israel Æra, the
subject will be investigated with that due consideration,
which every proposition demands; having an
apparent tendency to question the truth and authority
of Scripture.</p>


<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<h4>THE VOYAGE AND LANDING IN ANCIENT AMERICA.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">THE MEANS EMPLOYED TO CONCEAL THEIR DISCOVERY FROM THE
ASIATICS AND EUROPEANS&mdash;THE BUILDING OF THE FIRST ALTAR,
&amp;c.&mdash;THE PROPHECIES.</p></blockquote>

<p>We wish distinctly to be understood that we do not
state, or even infer, that in the intended voyage, the
Tyrians had any positive pre-knowledge of the existence
of a Western Continent,&mdash;but this we do believe,
that from their knowledge of Astronomy, they may
have had the supposition that such might be the case,
from the then known globular character of the Earth:
and in their desperate situation they must have felt the
sentiment of the African Prince, who to his favourite,
in reflecting upon the deaths that threatened them,
exclaimed in consolation, "Whatever world we are
next thrown upon, it cannot be <em>worse</em> than this!" With
the same feeling, in the second month of autumn, following
the last summer of their Country's fate, they
gathered all on board, lowered sail, and dipped their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
oars; they paused only, to cast their straining gaze
upon the horizoned Sons of Sidon, now about to be lost
for ever from their sight; for the solitary and home-bound
bark, with clued-up sail, and propelled by oar
alone, (for the Eastern wind would oppose their return,)
seemed but a darkened speck upon the distant circle of
the Sea. The same wind opposed to the Sidonian's
return, now filled the Tyrian sails, and bore their
Galleys from that Isle,&mdash;an emblem of human life,&mdash;where
the tints of Spring, Summer, and Autumn ever
reign,&mdash;and Winter, with his snow-crowned Peak rises
above them all! Being borne on Westward by the
constant current of Wind and Wave,&mdash;and without an
effort of their own,&mdash;and ignorant of the cause (they
experienced only the effects), and yet their speed perceptible
from the gradual sinking of the Island-base, they
must have felt the same sentiment as subsequently
Columbus did, and upon the identical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via acqua</i>,&mdash;that,
the Great Guardian of a good cause, must have
issued His mandate for their especial advancement and
protection!</p>

<p>Upon leaving the Island of the Seasons, the Tyrian
Pilots would naturally obey the direction of the friendly
breeze, and head their Galleys in accordance with it;
and this would be the more pleasing, as in their minds
it would appear ominous of their future safety,&mdash;for it
would direct them daily towards the Setting-Sun,&mdash;the
visible God of their Religion&mdash;and, therefore, as a consequence,
in the direct track for the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ocean-Titan of the Silver Crown,&mdash;Teneriffe,&mdash;gradually
falling beneath the horizon of the East, would
suggest to the "wise men" of the Galleys, to note his
bearing with the Stars of Night,&mdash;that the astral chart
might guide them for a return voyage, should their expedition
be prolonged beyond their means of sustenance:
for amid all the desolation, misery, and ruin of their
country, in which the savage Conqueror revelled during
his slaughter-banquet, although he triumphed over the
dead, he could not destroy the visionary minds of the
living&mdash;their knowledge of Astronomy made each rescued
Tyrian a Prophet of the deep! <span class="smcap">God's</span> handwriting
on the wall of Heaven (where the dazzling
Stars are His letters) was read correctly by these
Ocean-Daniels of Tyrus. That nation was indeed like
ancient Babylon, numbered and finished; weighed in
the balances and found wanting, and the kingdom divided
and given to the Conqueror; for her fate was
sealed, and by the Macedonian Signet, whose owner
solved the Gordian problem by the Sword alone!</p>

<p class="center">
"MENE MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN"
</p>

<p>appeared not only to the chief Son of Babylon;&mdash;the
"Daughter of Sidon" had it branded on her brow; and
in vain she wandered through her streets, striking with
trembling fingers the loosened chords of her once-loved
harp, to remind the passer-by of her former beauties;
the diapason of her heart could never more awake an
echo,&mdash;for <span class="smcap">God</span> had spoken to the Sea Queen&mdash;"I will
cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
thy harps shall be no more heard!"&mdash;but, the Chaldean
language of the Skies was not learnt by her Daniels in
vain: it had taught them in a former age, to guide
their bold prows from Pharaoh's fatal Sea; and coasting
around all Afric's burning land, enabled them to
pass the Herculean boundary Pillars, and so homeward
to the Nile and Tyrus, which after two score Moons received
them: and now, when the remorseless Conqueror&mdash;not
Science&mdash;drove their descendants forth
upon "great waters" where "the <em>East-Wind</em> could
have broken them in the midst of the Seas,"&mdash;that constant
gale from the Orient point, created with Time,
and will only cease with his decay,&mdash;that earth-circling
and never-varying gale from East to West,&mdash;<em>as if to</em>
<small>COMPEL</small> <em>Discovery of the other Hemisphere, and thence
praise the works of</em> <span class="smcap">God</span>!&mdash;that onward breeze, which
alone wafted the bold Genoese and turned the reported
vision to reality;&mdash;when the Tyrian Sons were again
upon these Seas, but now before that Orient gale;&mdash;still
the star-tracery on the azure wall of the eternal Dome,
and their Apollo daily sinking on his Western couch,
and with his last glance, beckoning them, as it were,
still to follow on his path,&mdash;this knowledge and their
Religious adoration, directed them in safety to that
Virgin land where the glorious Sun from Creation's
dawn, had never beamed upon a human foot-print,
until their own had kissed the untouched Floridian
Shore! There Flora and her attendant Nymphs in all
their peerless beauty, and Nature's own attire, were
grouped on every hill; from their coloured lips smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Welcome breathed forth, her ceaseless incense from
every mound and valley, which waft on Zephyr's wings
enrapt with health and gladness the approaching Sons
and Daughters of a distant Sea, whose wild songs of
praise to gorgeous Apollo were borne by their Orient
and faithful envoy to the wave-clad Shore:&mdash;Echo
caught the subduing chorus of the heart, and bore it to
her favourite haunts in mountain or in cave,&mdash;the
human voice now first heard, aroused the reposing animals
from glade and glen;&mdash;the feathery tribes in all
their rainbow tinted plumage, arose high in air,&mdash;played
their circles, and rested&mdash;music breathing&mdash;on
"the fruit tree-tops," as in the Day of Innocence, to receive
their names from the Adams and the Eves, of a
new-found Eden in another Hemisphere!</p>

<p>There arrived in joyous gladness, and welcomed by
all the gifts of Nature,&mdash;like an heir to sudden fortune
uncertain where to rest,&mdash;the Tyrian left the Shore of
Florida and coasted the Gulf of Mexico, and so around
the peninsular of Yucatan and into the Bay of Honduras;
they thence ascended a River of shelter and
safety, and above the rapids of which they selected the
site of their first City,&mdash;now occupied by the Ruins,
Altars, Idols, and Walls of Copan!</p>

<p>After their first sacrifice to Apollo, they would naturally
erect a Chief Altar, around which the Tyrian Pilgrims
who had come from "afar off to sojourn," might
gather in remembrance of the vital act from Sidonian
friendship.</p>

<p>As we firmly believe, so we repeat that belief,&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
the sculpture of the Chief Altar of Copan (as seen at
this day) portrays, from the hands of National Gratitude,
a Religious tribute to Sidon, who, amid the desolating
hurricane, had safely gathered the human
"gleanings" from the last field of their ill-fated country;
who had lifted up her prostrate "Daughter," and given
her renewed strength and power, whereby&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Her own feet <em>could</em> carry her afar off to Sojourn."
</p>

<p>Another Altar (sacred to Apollo) would be erected to
that Heavenly Science, the knowledge of which had
aided them over their watery track in safety and to
freedom. Their children would fail not to cherish the
altar-fire of Astronomy; the flame of which has, to the
human eye, not only illuminated the Earth, but unfolded
the Mechanism of the Heavens! It became the
ever-burning lantern to <em>their</em> feet, until they could
trace in Sculpture the annual glory of that refulgent
Orb, which, in their Father-land, had been for a century
of ages, the divine emblem of their Religion and
their God!<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>In preserving the secret of their discovery (their
ancient precept) there was one incident only to be
dreaded, and that was the possibility, at a future day, of
a portion of the colony becoming disaffected, and thereupon
resolving to return to the Fortunate Isles, and so
betray them. There was but one way to prevent this,
and that was, <em>by the destruction of their Galleys</em>,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
added to this, the passing of a law, that no others should
be built, and for the same reason. If this did take
place (as we believe it did) the cause is instantly apparent,
why their new-found Continent was for so many
centuries unknown to Asiatics or Europeans; and it
should be remembered, that the East-Wind, which, like
a friend, had wafted them to that Continent, would
oppose, as an enemy, any return from whence they
came.</p>

<p>Another cause may have led them to destroy their
vessels,&mdash;viz., a Religious offering to Apollo,&mdash;and
consequently <em>fire</em> would be the instrument of sacrifice.
It would be their first thought, upon a final landing,
to present to their deity the most precious offering in
their possession; and what had they so inestimable in
value as the very means whereby their lives had been
rescued?&mdash;and having made that sacrifice to Apollo,
fanatical zeal may have led them to abhor the future
use of means, which, as a grateful offering, had been
given to their deity. Thence may be traced the gradual
loss of Nautical practice, on an enlarged scale; and
the great Continent now possessed by them, would
also diminish by degrees the uses of Navigation.</p>

<p>The destruction of a fleet to prevent the return of followers,
was actually practised by Cortez, the conqueror
of the descendants of these Tyrians, and in the Gulf of
Mexico. He may have received from tradition in the
country, that such an act had been accomplished by
their Aboriginal ancestors: and when he repeated the
device, and for a similar purpose, he would, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
sake of his own fame, conceal the secret of his intelligence,
and thereby increase his character for dauntless
resolution. The Tyrians may have obtained their idea
from the act of Alexander of Macedon, who, only
<small>THREE</small> <em>years</em> anterior to their landing in Ancient
America, dismissed his Fleet before the great battle
with the Persians at Issus,&mdash;that his troops should
have no nautical means of returning.</p>

<p>We conclude this Chapter with the following solemn
belief, founded upon years of study and reflection:
viz.&mdash;As truly as a man in Europe or North America,
when he gazes upon the Sun's rising, will have his
shadow fall from his <em>left</em> side,&mdash;or if in Southern
Africa or South America, and in so looking at the orb
of day, that his shadow must fall from his <em>right</em> side;
so truly do we believe&mdash;(and with humility we write,
and in hope of Divine pardon, if in error)&mdash;that the
five additional Prophecies by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> have been justly
(though newly) applied by us to the fate of the
Daughter of Sidon; and especially the final one to the
Last of the Tyrians, rescued by the Sidonians at the
Alexandrian Siege;&mdash;and that the entire Fulfilment of
the great Prophecy was accomplished by their landing
and remaining on the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>"Her own feet <em>shall</em> carry her afar off to sojourn!"
And that that event took place three hundred and
thirty-two years before the Birth of that <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>,&mdash;whose
Advent was especially foretold by the same
Prophet!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="center">REVIEW OF THE TYRIAN ÆRA; OR, THE FIRST EPOCH<br />
IN THE PRESENT<br />
ORIGINAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT AMERICA,<br />
AND<br />
THE EVIDENCES TO SUSTAIN IT.</p>


<p>In summing up a case to the Jury, it is generally
understood that both Plaintiff and Defendant have
been heard,&mdash;and especially that the witnesses have
been cross-examined: in assuming, therefore, our present
position in regard to the summary of evidence, we
have endeavoured throughout this historic cause, not
only to be Plaintiff for the History, but have also in
many places been Defendant and cross-examined our
own points and witnesses, and even ourselves, in order
to anticipate and answer demurrers or objections.
Whether any apparent objections yet remain, and if
so, whether they have been sufficiently overruled by
the arguments, is for the Jury (<em>i. e.</em> the Public) to
decide; and whether the verdict be in the affirmative
for the Plaintiff&mdash;or in the negative,&mdash;we shall receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the announcement from the Foreman (<em>i. e.</em> the Press)
with perfect acquiescence in his judgment; and while
our blood and nature will not permit a cringing of the
knee for favour or for flattery,&mdash;yet we ask, and expect,
from that intellectual Foreman (whose voice is now
potential with the Jury) that liberal Justice which he
knows so well how to dispense: and especially in a
novel case, comprehending so enlarged a field of original
argument, reasoning, and resources as the present one.</p>

<p>To establish that the Aborigines of South and Central
(<em>i. e.</em> Mexican) America, were from the Last of
the Tyrian family in Asia, the following arguments and
evidences have been produced: viz.&mdash;The separation of
the Aborigines of the Western Hemisphere into two
distinct races, or people;&mdash;and that division justified
by absolute contrasts in their moral and physical condition
and manners,&mdash;in their political and Religious
customs and observances;&mdash;and in addition to these
powerful contrasts, is the fact,&mdash;that <em>North</em> America
possesses <em>no Architectural stone ruins</em>,&mdash;while in the
Mexican portion of the Continent, many Cities and
Temples have been found.</p>

<p>The great and injurious error of naming the Aborigines&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Indians</span>"&mdash;was
pointed out,&mdash;as well as the
Author, and the cause of the misnomer, and its effects.
The title of the first Epoch was then given, and the
arrangement of the several propositions for establishing
its truth.</p>

<p>An elaborate argument was next founded upon the
important and interesting question,&mdash;"Are the Fine-Arts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
of sufficient authority, to be received in evidence,
for establishing historical records or events?" Having
produced an answer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">con amore</i>,&mdash;and especially illustrated
the answer, by the resuscitation of the Ruins of
Rome, we proceeded in the belief that the argument
was conclusive and in the affirmative.</p>

<p>The fact was then established of the discovery of the
ancient Ruins in Southern or Central America,&mdash;viz.,
at Mitla, Cholula, Uxmal, Palenque, Quirigua, Ocosingo,
Tecpan-Guatimala, Gueguetinango, Quich&#275;,
Copan, Chi-chen, Zayi, Kabah, Espita, Ticol, and
Labnah,&mdash;and these severally upon the high authority
of the justly renowned Humboldt,&mdash;the Spanish
Commissioners Del Rio and Waldeck,&mdash;Dupaix and
Galindo,&mdash;and last, not least, the enterprising American
Traveller, Stephens,&mdash;and his artist-associate, Catherwood:&mdash;and
to which list may now be added the
name of Norman. Stephens has investigated other Ruins
in Yucatan, but they are precisely analogous to that of
Uxmal. Reference was then made to the Mexican
Paintings preserved in the Vatican, Bologna, and Madrid,
and republished in the folio Volumes by Lord
Kingsborough.</p>

<p>Extracts followed from the descriptions of the Ruins
of Copan, Palenque, and Uxmal, with such commentaries
as were required, for illustration of the Architecture
and Sculpture, or for detecting errors.</p>

<p>A Critical analysis was then presented of the conclusions
arrived at by Stephens, in reference to the
Architecture, and of the Nations rejected by him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
the builders. His errors were shewn by his own contradictions;
and the basis of his argument being
founded upon those errors, the conclusions, as a necessity,
fell to the ground; for it was shewn that the only
Nation or People that could claim to be the Architects,
and having means to reach the Continent, were not so
much as mentioned by him, and consequently not investigated.
If he had done so, it would instantly have
interfered with a favourite conclusion, which he was
determined to arrive at; if not by artistical and scientific
reasoning, at least by one of the noblest <em>traits</em> in the
human character,&mdash;viz., Love of Country. This was
so pardonable in a book merely of "Incidents of
Travel," that while it could not deprive honest criticism
of exposing the sophistry, it at once, from pure
sympathy in the sentiment, withheld the shaft of condemnation.</p>

<p>We then proceeded to prove, upon the direct rules
of Art, that the pyramidal ruins forming bases for receiving&mdash;and
with the peculiar superstructures on them,
that they were only traceable as Egypto-Tyrian Architecture&mdash;that
the Sculpture aided this conclusion, and
finally established the Nation to be Tyrian, from recording
the celebrated worship of Saturn,&mdash;the victim-craving
Moloch of Canaan's descendants.</p>

<p>A no less strong than interesting proof, we submit,
was brought to the consideration of the reader, in the
general identity between Solomon's Temple of Jerusalem,
<em>built by Tyrians</em>, and the Temples of Palenque
and Copan.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>A convincing catalogue of Analogies was then produced,
establishing direct identity between the ancient
Tyrians and Mexicans; even as to the manner of disposing
of the dead, as illustrated in the discovered
Mummies of the two Nations: to which proofs were
added the historical traditions of the Aborigines as to
where they came from,&mdash;viz., "the East:"&mdash;the place
where they first landed,&mdash;viz., "first touched at Florida,"
&amp;c.; and the period of their arrival,&mdash;viz., "before
the Christian Æra." Mr. Stephens's <em>second</em> visit
to Yucatan was alluded to, and it was shewn that the
additional discoveries did not only not oppose this
History, but on the contrary actually supported it. In
support of their own assertions of having reached the
Continent by means of Navigation, it was then stated,
upon the authority of the Spanish historian, Sahagun,
that they produced to Cortez, Maps and Charts of the
Bay of Honduras; and so accurate were they from
ancient times, that the Spanish Conqueror was saved
from wreck, during a perilous voyage in those Seas, by
following their direction.</p>

<p>The remains of an ancient Galley were mentioned
as having been found, deeply imbedded in the sands of
the eastern, or Atlantic shore, of South America; and
this was given upon good authority.</p>

<p>These facts, analogies, and traditions, naturally
turned the mind to a Nation, having the "means and
appliances" to reach the Western Hemisphere at so early
a period as that contemplated by the antiquity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
Ruins,&mdash;or the ancient days in which the traditions originated;
and having already established the builders,
from the Architecture and Analogies, to be Tyrian, it
was with singular pleasure when we found that the
Nautical investigation enabled&mdash;it compelled us&mdash;to
arrive at the same conclusion.</p>

<p>Tyrus, therefore, being as it were the Founder of
Ancient America, called for her antecedent history:&mdash;commencing
with a review of the Ph&oelig;nician nations
generally, we proceeded to give the history of the chief
events of Tyrus,&mdash;analyzing the romance and spirit of
the Tyrian People; unfolding her ill-directed commercial
policy and monopoly&mdash;tracing her rise and fall
to their <em>causes</em>, and thus removed the wonder created
by contemplating the terrible but certain <em>effects</em>. This
we humbly consider is the only true philosophy of
History. As we dwelt upon the reign of Hiram the
Great with that pleasure arising from delineating the
blessings of Peace and the progress of the Arts; so
were we elaborate in our description of the Siege and
Fall of Tyrus, through the invasion by Alexander of
Macedon,&mdash;that the horrors and curses of War, and the
destruction of civilization, should be the more forcibly
estimated by contrast; that Invaders or Conquerors
should receive the scorn and curse they deserve, and
Patriots and Peace-Makers the praise and blessings
they merit, and must receive from <span class="smcap">God</span> and Man! Our
history of the Tyrian Nation is indeed but a picture of
the past; yet we shall dare hope that it contains no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
useless record, but that in each event delineated, may
be seen the secret lesson for the present and the
future!</p>

<p>In Chapter VI. (Vol. i., Book ii.) was investigated,
the first circumnavigation of the African Continent by
the Tyrians, and we respectfully submit, that it was
established to have been accomplished, and that the
Fortunate Isles were discovered during that voyage.
The "means" possessed at that time for such an exposition,
or any other, were detailed; as also, especially,
the causes, effects, and locality of the East-Wind of
Scriptural language, and its influences in propelling or
opposing vessels to, or from, the Western Continent.</p>

<p>Having identified the builders of the ancient Cities
(from the Architecture, Analogies, and Traditions) to
have been Tyrians, it followed as a necessity for the
commencement of the History of Ancient America
that we must establish the year in which those Tyrians
landed,&mdash;still having regard to the antiquity of the
Ruins. That the migration to the Western Hemisphere
was <em>not</em> undertaken by the <em>Nation</em> of Tyrus in its days
of <em>prosperity</em> was, and is, conclusively established by
the fact that the voyagers never returned to announce
the accomplishment of the expedition, as they would
have done had they been sent by the King or Nation,
as in the case of the Voyage around Africa. If it had
been a National expedition, and they had under that
authority discovered the Western Continent, they must
have returned to Tyrus,&mdash;for the absence of the fair
portion of our race would prevent their remaining,&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
if they did remain, arguments in reference to descendants
could not be advanced, and therefore an useless
hypothesis in regard to the present history. Since
then the Tyrians did not reach the Western Continent
during the period of their national prosperity,&mdash;that
fact pointed at once to an æra when decay or desolation
had the ascendancy, and this did not exist until
their last doom and fall, when fire and sword felled the
nation&mdash;as an Island-Tree&mdash;to the earth,&mdash;a few leaves
only were rescued by a friendly gale, and thus escaped
the conflagration! That last day of Tyrus we distinctly
pointed out, and from undisputed history, to
have been the 20th of August, 332 years before Christ,
which date is not opposed by the character of the Ruins,
or the traditions of the Aborigines,&mdash;but supported by
both.</p>

<p>It was then pointed out that the "remnant" saved
by the Sidonians could nowhere land upon the shores
of the Mediterranean, from the natural fear of Alexander's
continued vengeance; and the "remnant," or their
descendants, cannot be traced in Europe, Asia, or
Africa,&mdash;except upon the Isle of Teneriffe,&mdash;as evidenced
by the discovery of the Mummies,&mdash;the identity
between them and those in Peru, we mentioned,
formed at once a connecting chain across the Atlantic.
The Fortunate Isles discovered by their ancestors
were their only refuge immediately after the desolation
of their country,&mdash;and being there, the fears of pursuit
would naturally possess them. With means furnished
by the Sidonians, it was submitted that freedom was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
assured to them; for, upon leaving the Island of the
snow-crowned Peak, their knowledge of Astronomy,
and the power of the Rowers would aid their voyage,&mdash;but
apart from those powerful adjuncts, it was proved
that the constant East-Wind would waft them Westward,
and with their double-rudders lashed amidships,
their Galleys must "touch at Florida," on a direct line
from Teneriffe, and within the changes of a moon,&mdash;thence
the voyage could not be of that duration to compel
return from the want of the means of sustenance.</p>

<p>In the translation of the Sculpture of the Chief
Altar at Copan, it was shewn that the magic Art had
<em>portrayed the identical act of friendship</em> leading to the
safety of the Tyrians; and their Nation is perfectly illustrated
by the accessories upon the Altar,&mdash;and having
translated the Sculpture, we maintained (in humble
submission to the opinion of others) that the definition
of the hieroglyphics on the surface of the Altar was
also arrived at,&mdash;upon the admitted ground of argument
that one but illustrated the other.</p>

<p>We have reserved a strong conclusive proof of <em>the
correctness of the date</em> assigned for the Migration until
this time,&mdash;and although not necessary for evidence,
yet it will (we believe) not fail to have its due effect
upon the critic. We will illustrate this proof in brief
chronological order: viz.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">606 <small>B. C.</small>] Voyage around the continent of Africa
by the Tyrians.</p>

<p class="hanging">585 <small>B. C.</small>] Commencement of the first Siege of Tyrus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
the mainland capital destroyed in the thirteenth
year, and thence became a vassal Nation.</p>

<p class="hanging">515 <small>B. C.</small>] Restoration of Tyrus as a Nation, after
seventy years of vassalage from the beginning of
the above siege, according to Prophecy.</p>

<p class="hanging">484 <small>B. C.</small>] Herodotus wrote his History of Egypt; in
it he mentions the great expedition around Africa
in 606 <small>B. C.</small> by the Tyrians; but that voyage only,
therefore, <em>down to his time</em> [viz., 484 <small>B. C.</small>] the
Migration to the Western Hemisphere had not
been attempted, and he wrote only 152 years before
the Alexandrian Siege.</p>

<p class="hanging">332 <small>B. C.</small>] Siege and destruction of Tyrus by the Macedonian.
Arrian makes no allusion to any migration
to, or knowledge by the Tyrians of, a
Western Continent, at any time during the period
from Herodotus to the last Siege,&mdash;it is, therefore,
a fair deduction that none took place, nor was it
known to that period,&mdash;viz., 332 <small>B. C.</small>&mdash;but at
that Siege, upon the authority of the same author,
many fugitive families were rescued (during the
storming of the capital) by the Sidonians.</p></blockquote>

<p>Down, then, to the period of the Siege of 332 <small>B. C.</small>,
no emigration to, or discovery of, a Western Continent
was known or recorded, and yet Tyrians are found
to have been upon that distant land,&mdash;both points we
claim at once to be admitted; and will, therefore, instantly
establish that the Tyrians landing in America
could be no other than those rescued by the Sidonians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
and as a necessity the date is correctly given for commencing
the History of Ancient America at 332 <small>B. C.</small>
To sustain this proposition of additional proof the following
brief argument is presented: viz.&mdash;Upon the
annihilation of <em>Canaan</em>-Tyrus;&mdash;and all its inhabitants
found within the walls being either murdered or
sent as slaves into Macedonia and other nations,&mdash;Alexander
repopulated the destroyed Capital with
people from the Grecian countries, and <em>speaking
the language of the Greeks</em>; the same was done at
Alexandria, and this language was there, and at Grecian-Tyrus,
continued to, and after, the time of <span class="smcap">The
Saviour</span>; and it had a material effect in advancing
Christianity, for Jerusalem being between Tyrus and
Alexandria, and the three capitals having that language
as the general medium of writing and conversation,
the early Doctrines of the Christian Church were
rapidly promulgated and promoted. After August 20th,
then, [332 <small>B. C.</small>] the <em>Greek language only</em>, in compliment
to, and by the command of Alexander, was spoken at
<em>Greco</em>-Tyrus; therefore (will not the critic anticipate?)
as an absolute necessity, admitting of no denial, if the
<em>Greek</em>-Tyrians had left Ph&oelig;nicia, and landed on the
Western Continent <em>after</em> the year 332 <small>B. C.</small>; and it has
been shewn that none of the ancient Tyrians reached
there <em>before</em> that period&mdash;<em>the Greek language</em> would
be found upon <em>the Altar of Copan</em>; instead of which,
<em>hieroglyphics</em> are only there; and they,&mdash;being translated
by analyzing the story of the attendant Sculpture,&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
once unfold the last incident in the Asiatic history of
the Tyrian family, descended from Sidon and the House
of Canaan!</p>

<p>As the Author, we stated in commencing the above
illustration, that this last proof of the correctness of
the date, was "a strong conclusive" one,&mdash;will it not
be regarded by the historic Reader as absolute and
conclusive?</p>

<p>If any documents of antiquity could be found,&mdash;written
in the Ph&oelig;nician character, and distinctly stating
the fact, that the Tyrians did migrate to the Western
Continent, and in the year specified, no one would doubt
<em>that</em> evidence; well then, those documents of the olden
time have been found, and readable only in the Tyrian
language;&mdash;they are to be seen at this day, upon the
walls and altars in Ancient America,&mdash;Architecture
and Sculpture were the true Historians,&mdash;and Old
Time,&mdash;the twin-born with Creation,&mdash;has been the
faithful Keeper of the Archives, and which unfold undeniable
Truths of Prophesied Religion!</p>

<p>And finally,&mdash;we brought forward for reflection and
solemn consideration, five branches of a great and
dormant Prophecy;&mdash;yet each within itself a Prophecy,&mdash;and
how truly they have been fulfilled, the
previous arguments (we shall dare believe) and the
historic facts have illustrated and established. If then
these Tyrian Prophecies are admitted to be correctly
applied,&mdash;and the proof of the last one, being identified
as having been fulfilled in Ancient America,&mdash;then, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
a necessity, the conclusion is,&mdash;that the Seal of that
Prophet is placed for ever upon the <em>truth</em> of this
branch of the present History.</p>

<p>An additional claim we now with confidence advance,
for receiving an acquiescence in the entire
Work, and as a necessity, in this portion of it,&mdash;viz.,
That the first Prediction in the Bible concerning the
Human Family, together with the Malediction of Noah
upon a branch of it, <em>are both proved to have been fulfilled
by the Tyrian and Israelitish identity in the
Western Hemisphere, and their Conquerors being of
the Spanish and Anglo-Saxon race</em>;&mdash;therefore, the
last words of the Diluvian Patriarch sustain the present
summary of our evidence. This interesting discovery
will be enlarged upon in the following and
concluding chapter, devoted to the refutation of
atheistical denials of the Truth of Sacred Prophecy.</p>

<p>In the belief&mdash;from the "foregone conclusions"&mdash;that
the first Epoch of the Western Hemisphere, identifying
the Southern division of it as Tyrian-America,&mdash;will
be received a verdict in the affirmative, we
shall proceed with the other branches of our cause,&mdash;viz.,
Israel and Christianity,&mdash;with renewed energy,
arising from the same firm conviction of their Truth.
The commencement of the Annals of Ancient America
will, consequently, be dated from the last siege of
Canaan-Tyrus by Alexander of Macedon, 332 <small>B. C.</small></p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE LAST.</h2>

<p class="center">
A REFUTATION OF ATHEISTICAL DENIAL OF THE TRUTH<br />
OF PROPHECY,<br />
FOUNDED<br />
UPON THE NATIONAL IDENTITIES<br />
IN<br />
THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>For had ye believed</em> <small>MOSES</small>, <em>ye would have believed
Me, for he wrote of Me; but if ye believed not</em> <small>HIS
WRITINGS</small>, <em>how shall ye believe</em> <span class="smcap">My words</span>?"</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> to the Pharisees.
</p></blockquote>


<p>The Tyrian translation of the "Rosetta-Stones" of
Ancient America, we maintain, has brought to light
the fulfilment of another Prophecy from Holy-Writ,
and which for centuries has been dormant from the
want of a correct, or an apparent application; but, that
Prophecy was uttered concerning the Tyrian Nation,
and is now directly applicable to those "sojourners
afar off." This discovery possesses a double power
and testimony: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>1st. It unfolds the <em>cause</em> why Tyrians should be on
the Western Continent, by pointing at the terrible
event, and its results leading to the <em>effect</em>.</p>

<p>2dly. While the Prophecy directs us to the fact of
the Tyrian Migration;&mdash;the discovery and identity of
the Tyrians being on the Western Hemisphere establish
the truth and fulfilment of the Prophecy;&mdash;thus
giving additional value to that portion of Scripture,
which in the eyes of unbelievers has been looked upon
with impious doubt or suspicion.</p>

<p>In a Work like the present, wherein an Original
Theory, claims to be admitted into the Library of History,&mdash;and
to be established there, upon the solid ground
of argument and investigation only,&mdash;there is, therefore,
no points of argument or objections that can consistently
be passed by as unworthy of notice: and
although under other circumstances, our early education,
and mature belief would not permit even the mention
of those sceptics, from whose lips in regard to this
Prophecy objections will come,&mdash;yet in justice to our
subject, and in duty and devotional gratitude to that
Religion, through the merits of which we believe Salvation
alone can be received,&mdash;we cannot retreat from
the encounter even with the foes of Faith, but boldly
meet them upon their own chosen field of atheism;&mdash;for
this discovery in Tyrian-America has forced them
into a defile, from which,&mdash;like the army in the Caudian
death-vale,&mdash;there is no escape from the guarded
and surrounding passes!</p>

<p>Arguments to prove Scriptural truths, are not required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
for those who have placed their hope, as an
anchor of Salvation, within the safe harbour of the Two
Testaments:&mdash;but, even those believers will rest upon
Ararat with confirmed security; and sceptics may be
led (from finding no resting-place) to approach that
Ark for safety, and to bring with them even the olive-leaf,
when Time continues to give forth, even at this
day,&mdash;renewed proofs that the visioned words of the
Sacred Prophets, were originally from The Supreme
<span class="smcap">God</span>!</p>

<p>Such a Divine herald was <span class="smcap">Moses</span>; and next in dignity
from the importance of his mission was <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>.
The millions of Christians now living, and the thousands
of millions covered by the mantle of death, within
the dark mansions of the grave, do, and have believed,
that that inspired writer truly foretold to Ahaz, King
of Judæa, that "God's sign" should be the <em>Miraculous
Birth</em> from a <em>Virgin</em>-Mother of a <span class="smcap">Redeemer</span>&mdash;of <span class="smcap">Christ
Immanuel</span>. [<em>i. e.</em> God with us.]</p>

<p>That same Prophet foretold the Fall of Tyrus. <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>
and <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> did the same. Their writings concerning
that event respectively bear date 712-606-588
years <small>B. C.</small> They also foretold that Judæa should
be captive to the Babylonian 70 years; which time,
computed from the capture of Jerusalem and destruction
of the first Temple, 588 <small>B. C.</small>, to the period of building
the <em>Second</em> Temple, 518 <small>B. C.</small>, would exactly complete
the fulfilment of the Prophecy: or if the time is
computed from the captivity of the <em>King</em> of Judæa,
606 <small>B. C.</small>, to the return of the Jewish people from Babylon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
536 <small>B. C.</small>, then the 70 years are, also, exactly accomplished.</p>

<p>Tyrus, said <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, should be forgotten as a Nation
for 70 years; which time, reckoned from the first year
of the Siege by Nebuchadnezzar, 585 <small>B. C.</small>, brings
the period to 515 <small>B. C.</small>, the year in which the
Second Temple was <em>dedicated</em>; and at which the
Tyrians assisting, they obtained again their National
position: therefore, that Prophecy, and that concerning
Judæa, were strictly fulfilled.</p>

<p>Now atheistical writers endeavour to maintain that
<span class="smcap">Moses</span>, <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>, <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>, <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>, and the
long line of Prophets never existed, and that the entire
Volume of the Bible was originally written by <span class="smcap">Ezra</span>! the
chief Priest and Lawgiver of the Jewish Nation, at the
return from the captivity in Babylon, 536 <small>B. C.</small>; and that,
as he wrote from 536 to 456 <small>B. C.</small>, therefore in composing
the Bible, <em>after the dates of the events specified</em>,
he could, and did, so arrange the Prophecies, as <em>if</em>
spoken by men who lived before the fulfilments, but,
who in fact (they argue) never did exist; and that he
wrote nothing for Prophecy, the accomplishment of
which was to take place after his (Ezra's) own time,
<em>and that no fulfilment of any Prophecy</em> <small>AFTER HIS TIME</small>
<em>can be</em> <small>HISTORICALLY</small> <em>established,&mdash;the foretelling of
which is anywhere found in the Old Testament</em>! That
is the data upon which atheists and deists found their
arguments against the Bible,&mdash;against the vital principle
of its truth,&mdash;viz., the Prophecies.</p>

<p>We, therefore, propose to meet those arguments, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
refute the reckless denials, upon their own chosen
ground,&mdash;giving them, even the advantage of the latest
date claimed by them,&mdash;viz., 456 <small>B. C.</small>, the latest period
in which Ezra wrote.</p>

<p>Before we refute their pseudo-reasoning upon the
Prophecies, we will shew that Scriptural authority is
<em>not</em> rejected by them; that it is distinctly allowed by
them, although unconsciously. It must be apparent
that they admit the authority of the Bible, and the
existence of the Jews as a Nation (which they deny),
for they accredit Ezra and his companions as writers
and compilers of The Volume, "after their return as
Captives from Babylon." Here then is a direct admission
(though unwittingly) that the Jews were a Nation,
and of sufficient importance to have been made captive
by so powerful a Monarch as the King of Babylon; and
that they returned at all, is only obtainable from the
Bible, and they admit "their return;" therefore they
admit the <em>record</em> of the Scripture!</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;they say with apparent triumph, in regard
to the Bible being in the letters of Babylon, and not in
the Jewish characters (and thence they deduce that the
Jews were not a Nation),&mdash;viz., "As all these men (Ezra
and his followers) had been captives in Babylon, and
could no where else be taught to write, how could these
Books (<em>i. e.</em> of the Bible) be <small>COMPOSED</small> in any other
than the Chaldæan characters?" <em>i. e.</em> letters.</p>

<p>We grant that the Bible was <small>TRANSLATED</small> by Ezra,
and his Scribes, into the Chaldee, which was the language
of the learned among the Babylonians, and acquired
by the Jews during their captivity; and is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
at this day, the language (<em>i. e.</em> letters) of our present
Hebrew Bible;&mdash;but, 36 years before the Captivity,
viz., 624 <small>B. C.</small>, the Mosaical Books of the Laws, (<em>i. e.</em> the
Pentateuch and others) were found in the Old Temple,
and they were read by Shaphan to King Josiah, and of
course in the original language of <span class="smcap">Israel</span> (<em>not Hebrew</em>),
which we will prove in the next Volume to have
been nearly identical with those of ancient Ph&oelig;nicia
and Egypt. Therefore, that the Book or Books were
now written by Ezra in the Chaldee&mdash;<em>or right-angular
letter</em>&mdash;is a conclusive proof <em>that it was a Translation</em>,
and being so, as a necessity, it must have been from an
<em>original</em> Book or Bible, and consequently, of <em>antecedent</em>
date to the period of Ezra.</p>

<p>Even in the Apocryphal Book of Esdras (2d) (and
quoted from as authority by atheists), and who is identical
from date with Ezra,&mdash;there is a sentence proving
the previous existence of the Bible, which he is about
to rewrite, or translate.&mdash;Esdras (<em>i. e.</em> Ezra) says, in
his address to The Deity,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But if I have found grace before thee, send the
Holy-Ghost into me, <em>and I shall write all that hath
been done in the World since the beginning</em> [<em>i. e.</em> the
Creation] <small>WHICH WERE WRITTEN IN THE LAW</small> [<em>i. e.</em> Original
Books of <span class="smcap">Moses</span>] that men may find thy path,
and that they which will live in latter days, may live."
[<em>i. e.</em> eternally.]</p>

<p>Now the capitalized line distinctly proves the existence
of a previous Book of "the Law," and in the original
language; and the preceding line defines that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
contained "all that had been done in the World" from
the Creation; therefore, the Books of Moses (and
others) as we read them at this day.</p>

<p>The first translation of the Bible was by Ezra, 536
<small>B. C.</small>, from the original language of Israel, into the Chaldee
characters; (<em>i. e.</em> incorrectly called <em>Hebrew</em> by us at this
day)&mdash;the second translation was from the Chaldee
into the Greek letters, in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus,
277 <small>B. C.</small>, when 72 learned Jews (Chaldee and
Greek Scholars) were employed upon the subject; consequently
the Bible remained in the Chaldæan language
untranslated for 259 years. In the period of <span class="smcap">The
Saviour</span> the Bible was read, not only in the Chaldee-Hebrew,
but in the Greek language; and that being the
prevailing tongue (as before stated) in Ph&oelig;nicia, consequent
upon the invasion by Alexander; as, also, at
Jerusalem and in Egypt, the precepts of the Old Testament
were, therefore, understood by the Jews and the
Gentiles, who were thus prepared to receive a <span class="smcap">Messiah</span>,
through the intelligence derived only from the Sacred
Prophets. <span class="smcap">Christ</span> visited the coasts of Tyrus and Sidon,
and was addressed by the Woman of Faith (without
doubt) in the Greek language. [Mathew xv. 21-28.]</p>

<p>The <em>New Testament</em> was originally written in the
Greek language,&mdash;for that was the language of the
learned at the period of the Apostles,&mdash;and consequently
the Gospel was quickly promulgated&mdash;both by
writing and preaching&mdash;to the nations surrounding Jerusalem:&mdash;thus
the invasion of Alexander,&mdash;by establishing
in Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, one language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
(<em>i. e.</em> the Greek) became an instrument, (although
from a pagan,) for the promulgation of the true Faith,&mdash;thence
fulfilling that "from evil cometh good."</p>

<p>The latest date of Ezra is 456 <small>B. C.</small>, and sceptics
boldly assert "That no Prophecy <em>previously</em> announced
[as to date] in the Bible, can be proved from <em>history</em>
to have been fulfilled <em>after</em> that date!"</p>

<p>The first refutation (apart from <span class="smcap">The Redeemer's</span>
prophesied birth) is from the Prophet <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. From
his vision he foretold that the fall of the Medes and Persians
should be caused by a Grecian monarch (<em>i. e.</em>
Alexander of Macedon), the former were portrayed
as the horns of a Ram, and the latter as a brutal Goat.
"And the Ram which thou sawest having two horns
are the kings of Media and Persia,&mdash;and the rough
goat is the king of Grecia." The <em>cause</em> for Alexander's
invasion of his enemy's territory is then given:
"Behold there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia,
and the fourth [Darius] shall be far richer than they
all, and by his strength, through his riches, <em>he shall
stir up all against the realm of Greece</em>."</p>

<p>The Prophecy then actually foretells what shall happen
upon the death of Alexander, whereby his identity
as the "king of Grecia" is absolute,&mdash;viz.,</p>

<p>"His (king of Grecia) kingdom shall be broken, and
<em>shall be divided</em> towards the four winds of Heaven, and
<em>not to his posterity</em>, nor according to his dominion
(Macedonia) which he ruled; for his kingdom shall
be plucked up, even for others besides those [<em>i. e.</em> his
posterity]. Now that (Alexander's dominion) being
broken, whereas <em>four</em> stood up for it,&mdash;<em>four kingdoms</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
<em>shall stand up out of the nation</em>&mdash;and in the latter
time of their kingdom, when the transgressions are
come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding
dark sentences shall stand up."</p>

<p>Now every classic reader knows that Alexander
conquered Darius, monarch of the Medes and Persians,
and that upon the death of the Macedonian, that
his kingdom was "<em>divided</em>" and that it did not descend
"<em>to his posterity</em>," that "<em>four kingdoms</em> did <em>stand up
out of the nation</em>"&mdash;[<em>i. e.</em> of Macedonia]&mdash;viz., Asia
was taken by Antigonus as his share;&mdash;Seleucus had
Babylon and the surrounding provinces, Lysimachus
the cities of the Hellespont, and Ptolemeus possessed
Egypt&mdash;thus were the four new kings created,&mdash;Macedonia
the original "nation," was given to Cassander.
Here then is the direct fulfilment of Prophecy, and
upon the authority of acknowledged History, which is
the authority desired by sceptics. Now for the data.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daniel</span>
prophesied 553 years <small>B. C.</small>, Ezra translated
the Bible from the original tongue [536 <small>B. C.</small>], therefore
ninety-seven years after <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>; but, following out the
atheistical assertion,&mdash;viz.,&mdash;no fulfilment is proved
from History (not Scriptural) after Ezra,&mdash;here then
is a conclusive refutation, for Alexander died, and his
kingdom was divided in 323 <small>B. C.</small>, <em>consequently 213
years</em> <small>AFTER</small> <em>the translation of the Bible by Ezra</em>; and
the historic facts are firmly established upon the
time-honoured authority of Arrian, Diodorus Siculus,
Plutarch, and Josephus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezekiel's</span> Prophecy of the first fall, and of the
general fate of Tyrus, was in the year 588 <small>B. C.</small>, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
years before the commencement of the Babylonian
siege. In that Prophecy he says,</p>

<p>"Therefore thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span>: Behold I
am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations
to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his
waves to come up. And they shall destroy the walls
of Tyrus and break down her towers. I will also
scrape her dust from her, and I will make her like the
top of a rock. <em>It shall be a place for the spreading
of Nets in the midst of the sea.</em>" * * * * * "I will
make thee <em>like the top of a rock,&mdash;thou shalt be a
place to spread Nets upon</em>, for I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> have spoken
it, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span>."</p>

<p>What Tyrus was finally to become is twice uttered
by <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>, as shewn by the above italicised quotations.
Ezra's latest date is 456 <small>B. C.</small>, but what is
Tyrus at the present day&mdash;<em>twenty-three Centuries after</em>
Ezra? Why it is the living witness of the actual and
identical fulfilment of the Prophecy!&mdash;for every Traveller
from the Mediterranean testifies to the fact, that
upon the <em>top of the rocks</em> of the site of ancient Tyrus,
are daily seen, spread out and drying in the sunlight,
<em>some fifty or sixty Nets</em>, belonging to about the same
number of fishermen, who reside in the vicinity! It is
scarcely necessary to add, that those poor fishers of the
sea have not in any manner been in collusion to establish
the Sacred writings; but in all probability from
their being uneducated Mahomedans, (yet believers in
the Koran) are in total ignorance of the Bible, or the
principles of Prophecy.</p>

<p>The foregone forms a refutation, no matter how late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
sceptics would date the writing, or the compilation of
the Bible, for the fulfilment has been seen for ages, and
is still visible upon the rocks of Tyrus. Why should
we wonder then that another proof of the truth of
Sacred Prophecy should only have been discovered in
our own day, and upon the Western Continent? But
mankind may well wonder, and they will so continue
through all posterity, at the mysterious and inscrutable
ways of The Almighty,&mdash;in the contemplation (we dare
not say contrast) of whose ever-fruitful Power, the high
soaring mind of man seem not only uncultured, but
inarable!</p>

</div></div>

<p>The discovery and identity of the <em>Tyrian</em> Ruins in
Ancient America must give a complete annihilation to
the impious argument of the atheists, for <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> wrote
256 years <em>before</em> Ezra, 380 before the Tyrian Siege by
Alexander, and 712 before <span class="smcap">Christ</span>. The first part of
the newly-applied Prophecy was accomplished at the
Macedonian massacre, and the rescuing of the "remnant"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
by the Sidonians,&mdash;this was in 332 <small>B. C.</small>, consequently
204 <em>years after the Biblical translation by
Ezra</em>:&mdash;while the last line of that Prophecy,&mdash;viz.,</p>

<p>"Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn,"
although accomplished in the same year, has only been
discovered (from the Ruins of Ancient America) to have
been fulfilled, together with the "local habitation," at
this present time,&mdash;<em>and therefore 2298 years after</em>
<span class="smcap">Ezra</span>,&mdash;and 2554 years from its original promulgation
by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>! And the reader should remember this important
fact,&mdash;viz., that the discovery of the Ruins has
been <em>since</em> the atheistical writings of the sceptics,&mdash;their
names we will not offend the eye with! If a man
would crush a serpent, he should not elevate it to an
idol, but place his heel upon its head, that it may be
trodden under foot, and so forgotten! Bring forward
the <em>venom</em> of the serpent, if you will, and analyze it,&mdash;that
you may avoid its corrupting qualities,&mdash;but give
no <em>name</em> to the serpent-sceptic itself,&mdash;lest that <em>that</em>
fame might have been the sole object of his ambition,
and by granting his wish, it would have the evil tendency
of inciting others to imitation. Many a public
villain has become so, merely from the desire of acquiring
the notoriety of a preceding one, whose name
could only be equalled, by the imitation, or excelling of
those crimes leading to the creation of the name. It is
the same in the path of virtuous Patriotism. To acquire
the name of an Alfred or a Washington, we must
imitate the deeds, or the quality of the deeds, that
made them so justly renowned,&mdash;<em>the Name of the Hero
is the attraction</em>,&mdash;and therefore, in all records of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
crime, the names of the criminals, should not be held
up to public gaze and wonder: for the desire of <em>evil
notoriety</em>, forms no small minority in the human
family. But in justice to fallen Nature, it would not be
difficult to prove that all atheistical writers have been
victims of insanity or intemperance,&mdash;the latter vice often
producing the former calamity;&mdash;and there is nothing
more astounding in hearing an unconfined Maniac deny
the existence of a <span class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;than that one asylumned
should assume that <em>he</em> is <span class="smcap">The Almighty</span>! or that one
should deny that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in his Divine Character was
upon earth, than that another should really believe
that <em>he</em> is the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>!<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But the misfortune has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
been, and is, that their <em>printed works</em> may be read by
persons of weak intellects, and so lead them into the
paths of darkness and confusion.</p>

<p>The Aborigines of North America cannot be made
to comprehend that an atheist really does exist, although
they have been so informed; it being so at
variance with their own confirmed and Religious conviction.
In illustration of this belief and veneration,
we may be excused from quoting from our own unpublished
Work upon Tecumseh,&mdash;the great Chieftain
of the Northern Aborigines. It is part of Tecumseh's
speech upon reviewing the Decalogue, and the necessity
of our Laws, and is addressed to an Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> seems to have alluded (inferentially at least)
to the Western Hemisphere in his Tyrian Prophecy,&mdash;he
writes:</p>

<p>"Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn!"&mdash;the
place or land, therefore, is not named by the
Prophet,&mdash;or its locality defined by any relative name
of any land then known,&mdash;yet it was to be "afar off,"
and to be reached by the means of Navigation, for the
remnant were to "cry aloud from the <em>Sea</em>" in thanksgiving
for their escape from the National massacre.
Throughout the Scripture, names of localities are
almost invariably defined; and in this very prophecy
by <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>,&mdash;he says&mdash;"The burden of <em>Tyre</em>,"&mdash;"Howl,
ye ships of <em>Tarshish</em>," "the land of <em>Chittim</em>,"
"the merchants of <em>Sidon</em>," "the seed of <em>Sihor</em>," "concerning
<em>Egypt</em>," "the land of the <em>Chaldeans</em>," "the
<em>Assyrian</em> founded it," &amp;c.&mdash;but where the "sojourners"
were to go is not specified, and for this apparent reason,&mdash;viz.,
that the "afar off" Continent had no "local
habitation <em>or a name</em>" among the then existing nations
of the Earth, whereby it could be designated; and
when to this is joined the fact, that the "remnant" of
the Tyrians are only found on that great Continent,&mdash;and
that wherever they went "afar off" it should be by
Nautical means;&mdash;these, we submit, form a conclusive
proof that what is now termed America, but then
nameless, was contemplated by the Prophet in his
great prediction;&mdash;for we think that we are justified
in the propositional belief, that when the pre-ordinance
of <span class="smcap">The Almighty</span> was manifested to the Prophet,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
sacred prescience then obtained, conveyed the
intelligence of the equi-hemispherical character of the
Earth!</p>

<p>Sceptics may say,&mdash;"There is the Prophecy of
<span class="smcap">Noah</span>!&mdash;is that sustained by these newly-discovered of
<span class="smcap">Isaiah's</span>, and by this present History?"&mdash;we answer
distinctly in the affirmative,&mdash;and further, that the
identity of Tyrians and Hebrews on the Western Continent,
together with their Conquerors, completely
establish the fulfilment of both the first Prophecy and
the Malediction!</p>

<p>After the insult to his person by his youngest Son,
the Patriarch uttered the Curse upon his youngest
<em>grandson</em>&mdash;Canaan, as enlarged upon in the commencement
of the Second Book of this Volume. The last
recorded words of Noah are as follows: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cursed be <em>Canaan</em>! a servant of servants shall he
be unto his <em>brethren</em>. Blessed be the Lord <em>God</em> of
<em>Shem</em>, and Canaan shall be <em>his</em> servant. God shall
enlarge <em>Japheth</em>, [the eldest] and he shall <em>dwell in the
tents</em> of Shem; and Canaan shall be <em>his</em> [Japheth's]
servant."&mdash;We offer the following brief analysis: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. <em>Canaan shall be the servant of Shem</em>:&mdash;proof
of fulfilment as follows,&mdash;viz., Canaan's ten younger
sons were the founders of the great family of the
Canaanites,&mdash;these were subdued, slain or made captives
by <span class="smcap">Moses</span> and <span class="smcap">Joshua</span>, of the House of Israel, descended
from Shem.</p>

<p>2d. <em>Canaan shall be a servant to his own Brethren</em>:&mdash;proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
of fulfilment,&mdash;viz., The eldest Brother of Canaan
was Cush, the founder of the Assyrian, Babylonian,
and Persian Kingdoms,&mdash;these conquered and
enslaved, or made vassal all the Nations of Ph&oelig;nicia,&mdash;these
latter countries were descended from Canaan.</p>

<p>3d. <span class="smcap">God</span> <em>should enlarge Japheth</em>;&mdash;proof of fulfilment,&mdash;viz.,
Japheth is regarded as the founder of
Europe,&mdash;branches of that family now overspread not
only Europe, but Asia, Africa, and the Continent of
America,&mdash;every part of the <em>Christianized</em> world is
occupied by the descendants of Noah's eldest Son!</p>

<p>4th. <em>Japheth shall dwell in the tents of Shem</em>:&mdash;proofs
of fulfilment,&mdash;viz., the great family of Israel
descended from Shem. When the Judæan branch was
made captive by the Babylonian, the Jews <em>returned</em> to
Jerusalem after 70 years, according to <span class="smcap">Isaiah's</span> prophecy;
therefore, they may be regarded as only being
<em>absent</em> from their Country. When again stationary,
and in their "tents" they were subdued by the Romans
in Judæa, who actually "dwelt in their tents" or habitations;
and even upon the site of the Jewish Temple,
in the following century, Hadrian built one to Jupiter.
The Romans were descended from Japheth.</p>

<p>At the Revolt of the Ten Tribes under Jeroboam,
that great branch of Israel retired to Samaria. They
were finally captured by the Assyrians and taken into
Media and Assyria. A small portion, however, were
suffered to remain at Samaria. Eventually a great
majority of the Ten Tribes reached the Northern portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
of the Western Hemisphere. The "tents" or
dwelling-places of these Israelites were, and are, at this
day occupied by the Anglo-Saxon and Norman races,
and these are of the family of Japheth.</p>

<p>5th and lastly. <em>Canaan shall also be the Servant of
Japheth</em>:&mdash;proofs of fulfilment,&mdash;viz., Canaan's eldest
Son was Sidon, who founded the kingdom of that name;
from Sidon descended Tyrus;&mdash;both were subdued,
destroyed, or enslaved by the Macedonians, who were
of the Japheth family.</p>

<p>From Canaan (through the branches of Sidon and
Tyrus) sprung Carthage. This nation was compelled
to be the enslaved "Servant" of Rome,&mdash;who, like
the Conqueror of Tyrus, was descended from Noah's
first-born.</p>

<p>From Canaan (Tyrus and Sidon) descended the
Guanches of the Fortunate Isles,&mdash;these were conquered
by the Sons of Spain, also of the European or
Japheth family.</p>

<p>From the Canaan Fugitives of Tyrus was founded
the Tyrian family in Ancient America,&mdash;these were
also massacred and enslaved by the Spaniard,&mdash;the
descendant from Japheth! Thus on the Western
Hemisphere, by the Cortezian and Anglo-Saxon Conquests,
was accomplished the finality of <span class="smcap">Noah's</span> Prophecy
and Malediction upon the last of the house of
Canaan!</p>

<p>The most discordant mind must perceive, even in
this brief review of Noah's Prophecy, the most perfect
harmony of Truth founded upon History;&mdash;and what is
the Bible if it will not bear this test? It consequently
demands the investigation of direct historic facts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
thence becomes the diapason of harmonious Truth,&mdash;the
Messiah of Language,&mdash;truly "The Sent of God"
for man's instruction here,&mdash;and his only hope of a
beatific blessing hereafter!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>While the collective contents of this chapter will
confirm the true belief in the Christian's mind, sincerely
do we hope that those who may have entertained
wavering doubts, will cast them from their stranded
hearts; and in future let those citadels of nature become
the confiding homes of refuge amid all the storms
of earthly life; may they feel in sorrow or misfortune,
that the Two Testaments,&mdash;like the Saviour of Life,
will pass over the wild waves of apparent despair,
and that the ocean of thought will be tranquil!&mdash;but to
the sceptic,&mdash;the God-denying atheist, and the labyrinth-lost
materialist,&mdash;we have presented the full language
of irrefragable argument,&mdash;have encountered
them with uncompromising resolution, and upon the
Ezraic ground of their own selection; and from which
they cannot retreat,&mdash;they must there remain confounded
and defeated; and to the following undeniable,
unanswerable conclusion they must be dumb,&mdash;or if they
speak, be it in humility and repentance: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>No sophistry or empty volubility, adorned with all
the inthralling powers of language or eloquence, can
controvert, or overthrow, established and <em>historic facts</em>;
they are the essentials to the proofs, and are the only, and
the conclusive proofs themselves, that Prophecies have
been fulfilled: when, therefore, incontrovertible truths
are brought from the archives of acknowledged History,&mdash;and
they substantiate&mdash;and undeniably,&mdash;the
actual accomplishment of Prophecies,&mdash;then those inspired
Visions of an unapproached future, upon being
so proven to have become the now stern realities
of the past, or of the present,&mdash;they must,&mdash;they can be
only viewed and received, as the Divine pre-ordinances
of <span class="smcap">Almighty God</span>,&mdash;promulgated to a wondering world,
from the hallowed lips of His chosen Prophets and
Mediators!&mdash;Such sacred messengers to Mankind, were
Moses, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel;&mdash;and the last Prophet
upon Earth,&mdash;fulfilling by His presence the Truth
of Holy-Writ&mdash;was The Son of God,&mdash;The Messiah&mdash;</p>

we have produced the following: and we predict, should any other
Cities or Ruins he discovered in Yucatan, that they will possess the
same general characteristics,&mdash;and consequently will not injure this
History,&mdash;but will rather tend to support it.
</p>
<p>
RESTORATION OF THE TEMPLE OF UXMAL, YUCATAN: <em>viz.</em>&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<em>First Terrace</em>, 640 feet long on each of the four sides, 5 feet high,
steps in centre on the several sides.<br />
</p>

<p>
<em>First Platform</em>, 20 feet broad.
</p>

<p><em>Second Terrace</em>, 600 feet on each of the sides, 15 feet high, steps
also in centre.
</p>

<p><em>Second Platform</em>, 205 feet to base of third terrace.</p>

<p><em>Third Terrace</em>, 400 feet at base; 35 steps, six inches tread; entire
depth 110 feet.
</p>

<p><em>Third Platform</em>, 30 feet, to the front of the Temple; all the
Terraces are cased with cut stone.
</p>

<p>
<em>Façade</em> of Temple, 320 feet: walls to first Cornice 25 feet high.
</p>

<p>
<em>Three doorways</em>, centre, 8 feet 6 inches wide, 8 feet 10 inches
high; the two lateral doorways the same height as the centre, and 6
feet 6 inches wide.
</p>

<p>
<em>Colonnade</em>, or Second Platform, composed of 230 circular columns,
each 12 feet high, and 18 inches in diameter; in two rows; the
columns 10 feet apart.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Single Altar-Column</em>, 6 feet diameter, and 60 feet high, in
centre of area.
</p>

<p>
<em>Base of First Terrace</em>, 2560 feet!
<br />
<em>Sculptured walls of the Temple</em>, 40,960 superficial feet!
<br />
<em>The Three Artificial Terraces</em> contain 72,800 cubic feet! G. J.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> It will scarcely be believed that so late as 1780 <small>A. D.</small>, the votive
worship was practised at Isernia, only fifty miles from Naples;&mdash;and
(upon the authority of Sir Wm. Hamilton) that three days in September
were given to this worship, which the Priests called the fête of St.
Cosmo; and at which, Maids, Wives, and Widows, publicly joined in
devotion. The King of Naples abolished it, upon the proof by Sir
William Hamilton.&mdash;G. J.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> While these pages devoted to the Analogies are passing through
the Press, Mr. Stephens has published his <em>second</em> visit to Yucatan.
Upon an investigation of the engravings of the Volumes, we find nothing
to change any portion of this History; but, on the contrary,
as we predicted in this Volume (see note to page 120), the additional
Ruins and Cities discovered, actually support our conclusions, and
confirm, consequently, this Tyrian æra. This is especially visible in
the Ruins of Labnah, which are directly in analogy with those of
Uxmal. We feel some pleasure that our artistical prediction has been
literally fulfilled,&mdash;otherwise it might have injured a portion of the
present Work&mdash;yet so slight, as not to have interfered with the principle
of this History. The time of their erection (<em>i. e.</em> the Temples in
Yucatan) therefore, still remains unchanged in the order in which we
ventured to place them; viz., that they were built <em>after</em> the Temples
of Copan, Ocosingo, Palenque, &amp;c. Up to this time (May 1843),
there have been discovered in Central America <em>twenty-six</em> Ancient
Cities, Ruins, and Temples:&mdash;yet with these additional witnesses
against him, the persevering Traveller still clings to the belief, that all
the Aborigines of the entire Continent were <em>one</em> People,&mdash;and that
they sprung up like the plants,&mdash;"indigenous" to that land,&mdash;and no
other! We have proved the fallacy of these propositions in our first
pages, and in the Chapter devoted to his artistical Refutations.</p></div>

ancient days of having National or other flags flying, for the purpose of
recognition, it may be necessary to show that it was the custom. This
is proved upon the authority of <span class="smcap">St. Paul</span>, who, after his shipwreck
upon the Island of Malta (<em>i. e.</em> Melita) and residing there three months,
again set sail in an Alexandrian ship for Rome; the ensign or flag of
which vessel represented the Jovian Sons of Leda. "And after three
months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the
Isle, whose sign (<em>i. e.</em> flag or ensign) was Castor and Pollux." [Acts
xxviii. 11.]&mdash;<em>G. J.</em></p></div>

Lunatic Asylum (England), now under the direction of the great philanthropist,
Dr. <span class="smcap">John Conolly</span> (the governor of the noble institution),

&mdash;The Maniac having somewhat recovered, was asked on a Sunday
if he would attend Chapel:&mdash;assuming a look of earthly pride, he
answered,&mdash;"To whom shall I pray?&mdash;I cannot offer prayers to <em>myself</em>!"
</p>
<p>
The other case, of a Maniac supposing himself to be <span class="smcap">The Saviour</span>,
occurred at Venice, in 1805: and to such an extent did his madness
inthrall him, that he made himself a "crown of thorns," which he
usually wore, and at last he actually attempted suicide by the means
of <em>Crucifixion</em>! He succeeded in driving nails through his feet and
right hand, and thus transfixed himself to a wooden <em>Cross</em>, and having
wounded himself in the side, in imitation of the spear-wound of <span class="smcap">The
Saviour</span>, he succeeded in throwing the Cross out of a window; and it
being secured with ropes, he thus exposed himself to the terrified
Venetians! <em>Atheists and Deists are but Maniacs, whose minds
are directly inverted to those believing themselves to be</em> <span class="smcap">The Almighty</span>
<em>or</em> <span class="smcap">The Saviour</span>.&mdash;G. J.</p></div>
